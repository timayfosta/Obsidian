Magic Items  
Magic items are gleaned from the hoards of felled  
monsters or discovered in long-lost vaults. Such  
items grant capabilities a character could rarely  
have otherwise, or they complement their owner’s  
capabilities in wondrous ways.  
Magic Item Categories  
Every magic item belongs to a category. The Magic  
Item Categories table lists the nine categories and  
provides examples. Rules for the categories appear  
after the table.  
Magic Item Categories  

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Category|Examples|
|Armor|+1 Leather Armor, +1 Shield|
|Potions|Potion of Healing|
|Rings|Ring of Invisibility|
|Rods|Immovable Rod|
|Scrolls|Spell Scroll|
|Staffs|Staff of Striking|
|Wands|Wand of Fireballs|
|Weapons|+1 Ammunition, +1 Longsword|
|Wondrous Items|Bag of Holding, Boots of Elvenkind|

Armor  
An item in the Armor category is typically a magical  
version of armor from “Equipment.” Unless an armor’s description notes otherwise, the armor must  
be worn for its magic to function.  
Some suits of magic armor specify the type of armor they are, such as Chain Mail or Plate Armor. If  
no type is specified, choose the type or determine it  
randomly.  
Potions  
An item in the Potion category might be a magical  
brew that must be imbibed or an oil that must be  
applied to a creature or an object. A typical potion  
consists of 1 ounce of liquid in a vial.  
Using a Potion. Potions are consumable items.  
Drinking a potion or administering it to another  
creature requires a Bonus Action. Applying an oil  
might take longer as specified in its description.  
Once used, a potion takes effect immediately, and it  
is used up.  
Mixing Potions. A character might drink one potion while still under the effects of another or pour  
several potions into a single container. The strange  
ingredients used in creating potions can result in  
unpredictable interactions.  
When a character mixes two potions together, roll  
on the Potion Miscibility table. If more than two are  
combined, roll again for each subsequent potion,  
combining the results. Unless the effects are immediately obvious, reveal them only when they become  
evident.  
Potion Miscibility  
1d100 Result  
01 Both potions lose their effects, and the  
mixture creates a magical explosion in a  
5-foot-radius Sphere centered on itself.  
Each creature in that area takes 4d10 Force  
damage.  
02–08 Both potions lose their effects, and the mixture becomes an ingested poison of your  
choice (see “Poison” in “Gameplay Toolbox”).  
09–15 Both potions lose their effects.  
16–25 One potion loses its effect.  
26–35 Both potions work, but with their numerical  
effects and durations halved. If a potion has  
no numerical effect and no duration, it instead  
loses its effect.  
36–90 Both potions work normally.  
91–99 Both potions work, but the numerical effects  
and duration of one potion are doubled. If neither potion has anything to double in this way,  
they work normally.  
00 Only one potion works, but its effects are  
permanent. Choose the simplest effect to  
make permanent or the one that seems the  
most fun. For example, a Potion of Healing  
might increase the drinker’s Hit Point maximum by 2d4 + 2, or a Potion of Invisibility might  
give the drinker the Invisible condition indefinitely. At your discretion, a Dispel Magic spell  
or similar magic might end this lasting effect.  
Rings  
For its magic to function, an item in the Ring category must be worn on a finger or a similar digit unless its description notes otherwise.  
Rods  
An item in the Rod category is a scepter usually  
made of metal, wood, or bone. A typical rod weighs  
2 to 5 pounds.  
Unless its description notes otherwise, a rod can  
be used as an Arcane Focus.  
205 System Reference Document 5.2.1  
Magic iteM Rules  
Rules for identifying, attuning to, and using magic  
items appear in “Equipment.” Additional rules are  
presented below.  
Attunement Prerequisites. If a magic item has  
a class prerequisite, a creature must be a member of  
that class to attune to the item. If a creature must be  
a spellcaster to attune to an item, the creature qualifies if it can cast at least one spell using its traits or  
features, not by using a magic item or the like.  
Items Made for Specific Creatures. Magic  
items that are meant to be worn tend to magically  
adjust themselves to the wearer. However, you can  
decide that a magic item doesn’t adjust its size to fit  
any wearer. For example, a particular armorer might  
make items usable only by folk who are sized and  
shaped like dwarves.  
Unusual Anatomy. Use your discretion to decide  
whether a creature can wear an item not made for  
its anatomy. A ring placed on a tentacle might work,  
but a yuan-ti with a snakelike tail instead of legs can’t  
wear magic boots.  
Paired Items. You can allow exceptions to the  
rule that paired items must both be worn. For example, a character with only one arm might be able  
to use a single Glove of Missile Snaring so long as the  
matching glove is on their person.  
Scrolls  
An item in the Scroll category is a roll of paper or  
parchment, sometimes attached to wooden rods  
and typically kept safe in a tube of ivory, jade,  
leather, metal, or wood. The most prevalent scroll is  
the Spell Scroll, a spell stored in written form.  
Using a Scroll. Scrolls are consumable items. Unleashing the magic in a scroll requires the user to  
read the scroll. When its magic has been invoked,  
the scroll can’t be used again. Its words fade, or it  
crumbles into dust.  
Any creature that can understand a written language can read a scroll and attempt to activate it  
unless its description notes otherwise.  
Staffs  
Items in the Staff category vary widely in appearance: some are of nearly equal diameter throughout  
and smooth, others are gnarled and twisted, some  
are made of wood, and others are composed of polished metal or crystal. A staff weighs between 2 and  
7 pounds and serves well as a walking stick or cane.  
Unless its description notes otherwise, a staff can  
be used as a nonmagical Quarterstaff and an Arcane  
Focus.  
Wands  
An item in the Wand category is typically 12 to 15  
inches long and crafted of metal, bone, or wood. It  
is tipped with metal, crystal, stone, or some other  
material.  
Unless its description notes otherwise, a wand  
can be used as an Arcane Focus.  
Weapons  
A magic weapon is typically a magical version of a  
weapon from “Equipment.” Some magic weapons  
specify the type of weapon they are in their descriptions, such as a Longsword or Longbow. If no  
weapon type is specified, you may choose the type  
or determine it randomly.  
Ammunition. If a magic weapon has the Ammunition property, ammunition fired from it is considered magical for the purpose of any rule that cares  
whether a weapon is magical or not.  
Wondrous Items  
Wondrous Items include wearable items such  
as boots, belts, capes, amulets, brooches, and  
circlets. Bags, carpets, figurines, horns, musical  
instruments, and more also fall into this category.  
Magic Item Rarity  
Every magic item has a rarity, which provides a  
rough measure of an item’s power relative to other  
magic items. The rarities are shown in the Magic  
Item Rarities and Values table.  
Common magic items, such as a Potion of Healing,  
are the most plentiful. Artifacts, such as the Dragon  
Orb, are priceless, unique, and difficult to acquire.  
Magic Item Values by Rarity  
Common magic items can often be bought in a  
town or city. Uncommon and Rare magic items are  
usually found only in cities, and rarer magic items  
might be sold only in wondrous locations, such as a  
city on another plane of existence. If you allow characters to buy and sell magic items in your campaign,  
rarity can help you set prices for those items. Gold  
Piece values are provided in the Magic Item Rarities  
and Values table, though a seller might ask for a service rather than coin as payment.  
If a magic item incorporates an item that has a  
purchase cost in “Equipment” (such as a weapon or  
a suit of armor), add that item’s cost to the magic  
item’s value. For example, +1 Armor (Plate Armor)  
206 System Reference Document 5.2.1  
has a value of 5,500 GP, which is the sum of a Rare  
magic item’s value (4,000 GP) and the cost of Plate  
Armor (1,500 GP).  
Magic Item Rarities and Values  

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
|Rarity|Value*|Rarity|Value*|
|Common|100 GP|Very Rare|40,000 GP|
|Uncommon|400 GP|Legendary|200,000 GP|
|Rare|4,000 GP|Artifact|Priceless|

*Halve the value for a consumable item other than a Spell Scroll.  
The value of a Spell Scroll is double what it costs to scribe the scroll  
(as specified in the “Scribing Spell Scrolls” section of “Equipment”).  
Activating a Magic Item  
It usually takes a Magic action to activate a magic  
item. The item’s user might also need to do something special. The description of each item category  
or individual item details how an item is activated.  
Certain items use the following rules for their  
activation.  
Command Word  
A command word is a word or short phrase that  
must be spoken or signed for an item to work. Spoken command words must be audible and fail to  
work in areas where all sound is suppressed, as in  
the area of the Silence spell.  
Consumable Items  
Some items are consumed—used up, in other  
words—when they are activated. A Potion of Healing  
must be swallowed, for example, while the writing  
vanishes from a scroll when it is read. Once used, a  
consumable item loses its magic.  
Spells Cast from Items  
Some magic items allow the user to cast a spell from  
the item. The spell is cast at the lowest possible  
spell and caster level, doesn’t expend any of the user’s spell slots, and requires no components unless  
the item’s description notes otherwise. The spell  
uses its normal casting time, range, and duration,  
and the user of the item must concentrate if the  
spell requires Concentration. Many items, such as  
Potions, bypass the casting of a spell and confer the  
spell’s effects with its usual duration. Certain items  
make exceptions to these rules, changing the casting time, duration, or other parts of a spell.  
A magic item may require the user to use their  
own spellcasting ability when casting a spell from  
the item. If the user has more than one spellcasting  
ability, the user chooses which one to use with the  
item. If the user doesn’t have a spellcasting ability,  
their spellcasting ability modifier is +0 for the item,  
and the user’s Proficiency Bonus applies.  
Charges  
Some magic items have charges that must be expended to activate their properties. The number  
of charges an item has remaining is revealed when  
the Identify spell is cast on it. A creature attuned to  
an item knows how many charges the item has and  
how many it regains.  
“The Next Dawn”  
Magic items often have charges or properties that  
recharge at the next dawn or some other specified  
time. If such an item is on a world or plane of existence where the specified event doesn’t occur, the  
GM determines when the item recharges.  
Cursed Items  
A magic item’s description specifies whether it  
bears a curse. Most methods of identifying items, including the Identify spell, fail to reveal such a curse.  
Attunement to a cursed item can’t be ended voluntarily unless the curse is broken first, such as with a  
Remove Curse spell.  
Magic Item Resilience  
A magic item is at least as durable as a nonmagical  
item of its kind. Most magic items, other than Potions and Scrolls, have Resistance to all damage.  
An Artifact can be destroyed only in some special  
way. Otherwise, it is impervious to damage. Learning how to destroy an Artifact usually requires  
research or the completion of a quest.  
Crafting Magic Items  
“Equipment” contains rules on brewing Potions of  
Healing and scribing Spell Scrolls. To create other  
magic items, follow the rules below. In these rules,  
“you” refers to the character crafting the magic  
item.  
Arcana Proficiency  
To craft a magic item, you and any assistants must  
have proficiency in the Arcana skill.  
Tools  
The Magic Item Tools table lists which tool is required to make a magic item of each category. You  
must use the required tool to make an item and  
have proficiency with that tool. Any assistants must  
also have proficiency with it. For more information  
on the tools, see “Equipment.”

|Wondrous Item|

Spells  
If a magic item allows its user to cast any spells  
from it, you must have all those spells prepared every day you spend crafting the item.  
Time and Cost  
Crafting a magic item takes an amount of time and  
money based on the item’s rarity as shown in the  
Magic Item Crafting Time and Cost table.  
Work per Day. For each day of crafting, you must  
work for 8 hours. If an item requires multiple days,  
those days needn’t be consecutive.  
Assistants. Characters can combine their efforts  
to shorten the crafting time. Divide the time needed  
to create an item by the number of characters working on it. Normally, only one other character can  
assist you, but the GM might allow more assistants.  
Raw Materials. The cost in the table represents  
the raw materials needed to make a magic item. The  
GM determines whether appropriate raw materials  
are available. In a city, there is a 75 percent chance  
that the materials are available, and in any other  
settlement, that chance is 25 percent. If materials  
aren’t available, you must wait at least 7 days before  
checking on the availability again.  
If a magic item incorporates an item that has a  
purchase cost (such as a weapon or a suit of armor),  
you must also pay that entire cost or craft that item  
using the rules in “Equipment.” For example, to  
make +1 Armor (Plate Armor), you must pay 3,500  
GP or pay 2,000 GP and craft the armor.  
Magic Item Crafting Time and Cost  

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Item Rarity  <br>Common  <br>Uncommon  <br>Rare  <br>Very Rare  <br>Legendary|Time*  <br>5 days  <br>10 days  <br>50 days  <br>125 days  <br>250 days|Cost*  <br>50 GP  <br>200 GP  <br>2,000 GP  <br>20,000 GP  <br>100,000 GP|

*The time and cost are halved for a consumable item other than  
a Spell Scroll, whose crafting time and cost are given in “Equipment.”  
Sentient Magic Items  
Some magic items have sentience and personality.  
Such an item might be possessed, haunted by the  
spirit of a previous owner, or self-aware thanks to  
the magic used to create it. A sentient item might be  
a cherished ally to its wielder or a continual thorn in  
the side.  
Most sentient items are weapons, but other kinds  
of items can manifest sentience. Single-use items  
such as potions and scrolls are never sentient.  
The GM controls sentient magic items and their  
activated properties. A bearer who maintains a  
good relationship with the item can access those  
properties. If the relationship is strained, a conflict  
can ensue (see “Conflict” below).  
Sentient Magic Item Traits  
When you make a sentient magic item, you create  
the item’s persona much as you would create an  
NPC, with these exceptions.  
Abilities  
A sentient magic item has Intelligence, Wisdom, and  
Charisma scores. Choose the item’s abilities, or determine them randomly as follows: roll 4d6 for each  
one, dropping the lowest roll and totaling the rest.  
Alignment  
A sentient magic item has an alignment. Its creator  
or nature might suggest an alignment. Otherwise,  
pick an alignment or roll on the Sentient Item’s  
Alignment table.  
Communication  
A sentient item communicates by sharing its emotions, broadcasting its thoughts telepathically, or  
speaking aloud. You can choose how it communicates or roll on the Sentient Item’s Communication  
table.  
Senses  
A sentient item can perceive its surroundings out to  
a limited range. You can choose its senses or roll on  
the Sentient Item’s Senses table.  
208 System Reference Document 5.2.1  
Special Purpose  
You can give a sentient item an objective it pursues,  
perhaps to the exclusion of all else. As long as the  
wielder’s use of the item aligns with that special  
purpose, the item remains cooperative. Deviating  
from this course might cause conflict between the  
wielder and the item (see “Conflict” below). You can  
pick a special purpose or roll on the Sentient Item’s  
Special Purpose table.  
Sentient Item’s Alignment  

|   |   |
|---|---|
|1d100 Alignment  <br>01–15 Lawful Good  <br>16–35 Neutral Good  <br>36–50 Chaotic Good  <br>51–63 Lawful Neutral  <br>64–73 Neutral|1d100 Alignment  <br>74–85 Chaotic Neutral  <br>86–89 Lawful Evil  <br>90–96 Neutral Evil  <br>97–00 Chaotic Evil|

Sentient Item’s Special Purpose  

|   |   |
|---|---|
|1d10  <br>1|Special Purpose  <br>Aligned. The item seeks to defeat or destroy  <br>those of a diametrically opposed alignment.  <br>Such an item is never Neutral.|

2 Bane. The item seeks to thwart or destroy  
creatures of a particular type, such as Constructs, Fiends, or Undead.  
3 Creator Seeker. The item seeks its creator  
and wants to understand why it was created.  
4 Destiny Seeker. The item believes it and its  
bearer have key roles to play in future events.  

|   |   |
|---|---|
|1d10  <br>5|Special Purpose  <br>Destroyer. The item craves destruction and  <br>goads its user to fight arbitrarily.|

6 Glory Seeker. The item seeks renown as the  
greatest magic item in the world by winning  
fame or notoriety for its user.  
7 Lore Seeker. The item craves knowledge or is  
determined to solve a mystery, learn a secret,  
or unravel a cryptic prophecy.  
8 Protector. The item seeks to defend a particular kind of creature, such as elves or  
werewolves.  
9 Soulmate Seeker. The item seeks another  
sentient magic item, perhaps one that is similar  
to itself.  
10 Templar. The item seeks to defend the servants and interests of a particular deity.  
Conflict  
When the bearer of a sentient item acts in a manner  
opposed to the item’s alignment or purpose, conflict  
can arise. When such a conflict occurs, the item’s  
bearer makes a Charisma saving throw (DC 12 plus  
the item’s Charisma modifier). On a failed save, the  
item makes one or more of the following demands:  
Chase My Dreams. The item demands that its  
bearer pursue the item’s goals to the exclusion of  
all other goals.  
Get Rid of It. The item demands that its bearer dispose of anything the item finds repugnant.  
It’s Time for a Change. The item demands to be  
given to someone else.  
Keep Me Close. The item insists on being carried or  
worn at all times.  
If its bearer refuses to comply with the item’s demands, the item can do any of the following:  
• Make it impossible for its bearer to attune to it.  
• Suppress one or more of its activated properties.  
• Attempt to take control of its bearer, whereupon  
the bearer makes a Charisma saving throw (DC  
12 plus the item’s Charisma modifier). On a failed  
save, the bearer has the Charmed condition for  
1d12 hours. While Charmed in this way, the  
bearer must try to follow the item’s commands.  
If the bearer takes damage, it repeats the save,  
ending the effect on a success. Whether or not the  
attempt to control its bearer succeeds, the item  
can’t use this power again until the next dawn.

Magic Items A–Z  
Magic items are presented in alphabetical order.  
If a magic item description capitalizes a creature’s  
name and presents it in bold type, that’s a visual  
cue pointing you to the creature’s stat block. Unless  
the text states otherwise, the stat block is in “Monsters.” How to read and use a stat block is explained  
in “Monsters.”  
Adamantine Armor  
Armor (Any Medium or Heavy, Except Hide Armor),  
Uncommon  
This suit of armor is reinforced with adamantine,  
one of the hardest substances in existence. While  
you’re wearing it, any Critical Hit against you becomes a normal hit.  
Ammunition, +1, +2, or +3  
Weapon (Any Ammunition), Uncommon (+1), Rare (+2),  
or Very Rare (+3)  
You have a bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls  
made with this piece of magic ammunition. The bonus is determined by the rarity of the ammunition.  
Once it hits a target, the ammunition is no longer  
magical.  
This ammunition is typically found or sold in  
quantities of ten or twenty pieces. Ten pieces of this  
ammunition are equivalent in value to a potion of  
the same rarity.  
Ammunition of Slaying  
Weapon (Any Ammunition), Very Rare  
This magic ammunition is meant to slay creatures  
of a particular type, which the GM chooses or determines randomly by rolling on the table below. If  
a creature of that type takes damage from the ammunition, the creature makes a DC 17 Constitution  
saving throw, taking an extra 6d10 Force damage  
on a failed save or half as much extra damage on a  
successful one.  
After dealing its extra damage to a creature, the  
ammunition becomes nonmagical.

Amulet of the Planes  
Wondrous Item, Very Rare (Requires Attunement)  
While wearing this amulet, you can take a Magic  
action to name a location that you are familiar with  
on another plane of existence. Then make a DC 15  
Intelligence (Arcana) check. On a successful check,  
you cast Plane Shift. On a failed check, you and each  
creature and object within 15 feet of you travel to  
a random destination determined by rolling 1d100  
and consulting the following table.

Action to cause it to animate. The Shield leaps into  
the air and hovers in your space to protect you as if  
you were wielding it, leaving your hands free. The  
Shield remains animate for 1 minute, until you take  
a Bonus Action to end this effect, or until you die or

Shield falls to the ground or into your hand if you  
have one free.

Apparatus of the Crab  
Wondrous Item, Legendary  
This item first appears to be a sealed iron barrel  
weighing 500 pounds. The barrel has a hidden  
catch, which can be found with a successful DC 20  
Intelligence (Investigation) check. Releasing the  
catch unlocks a hatch at one end of the barrel, allowing two Medium or smaller creatures to crawl  
inside. Ten levers are set in a row at the far end,  
each in a neutral position, able to move up or down.  
When certain levers are used, the apparatus transforms to resemble a giant lobster.  
The Apparatus of the Crab is a Large object with  
the following statistics: AC 20; HP 200; Speed 30  
ft., Swim 30 ft. (or 0 ft. for both if the legs aren’t extended); Immunity to Poison and Psychic damage.  
To be used as a vehicle, the apparatus requires  
one pilot. While the apparatus’s hatch is closed, the  
compartment is airtight and watertight. The compartment holds enough air for 10 hours of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures  
inside.  
The apparatus floats on water. It can also go  
underwater to a depth of 900 feet. Below that, the  
vehicle takes 2d6 Bludgeoning damage each minute  
from pressure.  
A creature in the compartment can take a Utilize  
action to move as many as two of the apparatus’s  
levers up or down. After each use, a lever goes back  
to its neutral position. Each lever, from left to right,  
functions as shown in the Apparatus of the Crab  
Levers table.  
Armor, +1, +2, or +3

Slashing damage while you wear this armor.  
Metal Shell. You can take a Magic action to give  
yourself Immunity to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and  
Slashing damage for 10 minutes or until you are  
no longer wearing the armor. Once this property is  
used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.  
Armor of Resistance  
Armor (Any Light, Medium, or Heavy), Rare (Requires  
Attunement)  
You have Resistance to one type of damage while  
you wear this armor. The GM chooses the type or

211 System Reference Document 5.2.1  
Armor of Vulnerability  
Armor (Any Light, Medium, or Heavy), Rare (Requires  
Attunement)  
While wearing this armor, you have Resistance to  
one of the following damage types: Bludgeoning,  
Piercing, or Slashing. The GM chooses the type or  
determines it randomly.  
Curse. This armor is cursed, a fact that is revealed  
only when the Identify spell is cast on the armor or  
you attune to it. Attuning to the armor curses you  
until you are targeted by a Remove Curse spell or  
similar magic; removing the armor fails to end the  
curse. While cursed, you have Vulnerability to two  
of the three damage types associated with the armor (not the one to which it grants Resistance).  
Arrow-Catching Shield  
Armor (Shield), Rare (Requires Attunement)  
You gain a +2 bonus to Armor Class against ranged  
attack rolls while you wield this Shield. This bonus  
is in addition to the Shield’s normal bonus to AC.  
Whenever an attacker makes a ranged attack roll  
against a target within 5 feet of you, you can take a  
Reaction to become the target of the attack instead.  
Bag of Beans  
Wondrous Item, Rare  
This heavy cloth bag contains 3d4 dry beans when  
found. The bag weighs half a pound regardless of  
how many beans it contains and becomes a nonmagical item when it no longer contains any beans.  
If you dump one or more beans out of the bag,  
they explode in a 10-foot-radius Sphere centered on  
them. All the dumped beans are destroyed in the explosion, and each creature in the Sphere, including  
you, makes a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking  
5d4 Force damage on a failed save or half as much  
damage on a successful one.  
If you remove a bean from the bag, plant it in dirt  
or sand, and then water it, the bean disappears as it  
produces an effect 1 minute later from the ground  
where it was planted. The GM can choose an effect  
from the following table or determine it randomly.  
1d100 Effect  
01 5d4 toadstools sprout. If a creature eats a  
toadstool, roll any die. On an odd roll, the  
eater must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution  
saving throw or take 5d6 Poison damage and  
have the Poisoned condition for 1 hour. On  
an even roll, the eater gains 5d6 Temporary  
Hit Points for 1 hour.  
02–10 A geyser erupts and spouts water, beer,  
mayonnaise, tea, vinegar, wine, or oil (GM’s  
choice) 30 feet into the air for 1d4 minutes.  
1d100 Effect  
11–20 A Treant sprouts. Roll any die. On an odd  
roll, the treant is Chaotic Evil. On an even  
roll, the treant is Chaotic Good.  
21–30 An animate but immobile stone statue in  
your likeness rises and makes verbal threats  
against you. If you leave it and others come  
near, it describes you as the most heinous  
of villains and directs the newcomers to find  
and attack you. If you are on the same plane  
of existence as the statue, it knows where  
you are. The statue becomes inanimate after  
24 hours.  
31–40 A campfire with green flames springs  
forth and burns for 24 hours or until it is  
extinguished.  
41–50 Three Shrieker Fungi sprout.  
51–60 1d4 + 4 bright-pink toads crawl forth. Whenever a toad is touched, it transforms into a  
Large or smaller monster of the GM’s choice  
that acts in accordance with its alignment  
and nature. The monster remains for 1 minute, then disappears in a puff of bright-pink  
smoke.  
61–70 A hungry Bulette burrows up and attacks.  
71–80 A fruit tree grows. It has 1d10 + 20 fruit, 1d8  
of which act as randomly determined potions. The tree vanishes after 1 hour. Picked  
fruit remains, retaining any magic for 30 days.  
81–90 A nest of 1d4 + 3 rainbow-colored eggs  
springs up. Any creature that eats an egg  
makes a DC 20 Constitution saving throw.  
On a successful save, a creature permanently  
increases its lowest ability score by 1, randomly choosing among equally low scores.  
On a failed save, the creature takes 10d6  
Force damage from an internal explosion.  
91–95 A pyramid with a 60-foot-square base bursts  
upward. Inside is a burial chamber containing  
a Mummy, a Mummy Lord, or some other  
Undead of the GM’s choice. Its sarcophagus  
contains treasure of the GM’s choice.  
96–00 A giant beanstalk sprouts, growing to a  
height of the GM’s choice. The top leads  
where the GM chooses, such as to a great  
view, a cloud giant’s castle, or another plane  
of existence.  
212 System Reference Document 5.2.1  
Bag of Devouring  
Wondrous Item, Very Rare  
This bag resembles a Bag of Holding but is a feeding  
orifice for a gigantic extradimensional creature.  
Turning the bag inside out closes the orifice.  
The extradimensional creature attached to the  
bag can sense whatever is placed inside the bag.  
Animal or vegetable matter placed wholly in the  
bag is devoured and lost forever. When part of a living creature is placed in the bag, as happens when  
someone reaches inside it, there is a 50 percent  
chance that the creature is pulled inside the bag. A  
creature inside the bag can take an action to try to  
escape, doing so with a successful DC 15 Strength  
(Athletics) check. Another creature can take an action to reach into the bag to pull a creature out, doing so with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics)  
check, provided the puller isn’t pulled inside the bag  
first. Any creature that starts its turn inside the bag  
is devoured, its body destroyed.  
Inanimate objects can be stored in the bag, which  
can hold a cubic foot of such material. However,  
once each day, the bag swallows any objects inside  
it and spits them out into another plane of existence.  
The GM determines the time and plane.  
If the bag is pierced or torn, it is destroyed, and  
anything contained within it is transported to a  
random location on the Astral Plane.  
Bag of Holding  
Wondrous Item, Uncommon  
This bag has an interior space considerably larger  
than its outside dimensions—roughly 2 feet square  
and 4 feet deep on the inside. The bag can hold up  
to 500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic  
feet. The bag weighs 5 pounds, regardless of its  
contents. Retrieving an item from the bag requires  
a Utilize action.  
If the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it is destroyed, and its contents are scattered in the Astral  
Plane. If the bag is turned inside out, its contents  
spill forth unharmed, but the bag must be put right  
before it can be used again. The bag holds enough  
air for 10 minutes of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.  
Placing a Bag of Holding inside an extradimensional space created by a Handy Haversack, Portable  
Hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items  
and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the  
other. Any creature within a 10-foot-radius Sphere  
centered on the gate is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then  
closes. The gate is one-way and can’t be reopened.  
Bag of Tricks  
Wondrous Item, Uncommon  
This bag made from gray, rust, or tan cloth appears  
empty. Reaching inside the bag, however, reveals  
the presence of a small, fuzzy object.  
You can take a Magic action to pull the fuzzy object from the bag and throw it up to 20 feet. When  
the object lands, it transforms into a creature you  
determine by rolling on the table that corresponds  
to the bag’s color. See “Monsters” for the creature’s  
stat block. The creature vanishes at the next dawn  
or when it is reduced to 0 Hit Points.  
The creature is Friendly to you and your allies,  
and it acts immediately after you on your Initiative  
count. You can take a Bonus Action to command  
how the creature moves and what action it takes on  
its next turn, such as attacking an enemy. In the absence of such orders, the creature acts in a fashion  
appropriate to its nature.  
Once three fuzzy objects have been pulled from  
the bag, the bag can’t be used again until the next  
dawn.

Bead of Force  
Wondrous Item, Rare  
This small black sphere measures 3/4 of an inch in  
diameter and weighs an ounce. Typically, 1d4 + 4  
Beads of Force are found together.  
You can take a Magic action to throw the bead up  
to 60 feet. The bead explodes in a 10-foot-radius  
Sphere on impact and is destroyed. Each creature  
213 System Reference Document 5.2.1  
in the Sphere must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity  
saving throw or take 5d4 Force damage. A sphere  
of transparent force then encloses the area for 1  
minute. Any creature that failed the save and is  
completely within the area is trapped inside this  
sphere. Creatures that succeeded on the save or are  
partially within the area are pushed away from the  
center of the sphere until they are no longer inside  
it. Only breathable air can pass through the sphere’s  
wall. No attack or other effect can pass through.  
An enclosed creature can take a Utilize action to  
push against the sphere’s wall, moving the sphere  
up to half the creature’s Speed. The sphere can be  
picked up, and its magic causes it to weigh only 1  
pound, regardless of the weight of creatures inside.  
Bead of Nourishment  
Wondrous Item, Common  
This flavorless, gelatinous bead dissolves on your  
tongue and provides as much nourishment as 1 day  
of Rations.  
Belt of Dwarvenkind  
Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement)  
While wearing this belt, you gain the following  
benefits:  
Dwarvish. You know Dwarvish.  
Friend of Dwarvenkind. You have Advantage on  
Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to interact  
with dwarves and duergar.  
Toughness. Your Constitution increases by 2, to a  
maximum of 20.  
In addition, while attuned to the belt, you have a 50  
percent chance each day at dawn of growing a full  
beard if you can grow one, or a thicker beard if you  
already have one.  
If you aren’t a dwarf or duergar, you gain the following additional benefits while wearing the belt:  
Darkvision. You have Darkvision with a range of 60  
feet.  
Resilience. You have Resistance to Poison damage.

Wondrous Item, Rarity Varies (Requires Attunement)  
While wearing this belt, your Strength changes to  
a score granted by the belt. The type of giant determines the score (see the table below). The item has  
no effect on you if your Strength without the belt is  
equal to or greater than the belt’s score.

Berserker Axe  
Weapon (Battleaxe, Greataxe, or Halberd), Rare  
(Requires Attunement)  
You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls  
made with this magic weapon. In addition, while  
you are attuned to this weapon, your Hit Point  
maximum increases by 1 for each level you have  
attained.  
Curse. This weapon is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. As long as you  
remain cursed, you are unwilling to part with the  
weapon, keeping it within reach at all times. You  
also have Disadvantage on attack rolls with weapons other than this one.  
Whenever another creature damages you while  
the weapon is in your possession, you must succeed  
on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or go berserk. This  
berserk state ends when you start your turn and  
there are no creatures within 60 feet of you that you  
can see or hear.  
While berserk, you regard the creature nearest  
to you that you can see or hear as your enemy. If  
there are multiple possible creatures, choose one at  
random. On each of your turns, you must move as  
close to the creature as possible and take the Attack  
action, targeting the creature. If you’re unable to  
get close enough to the creature to attack it with  
the weapon, your turn ends after you’ve used up all  
your available movement. If the creature dies or can  
no longer be seen or heard by you, the next nearest  
creature that you can see or hear becomes your  
new target.  
Boots of Elvenkind  
Wondrous Item, Uncommon  
While you wear these boots, your steps make no  
sound, regardless of the surface you are moving  
across. You also have Advantage on Dexterity  
(Stealth) checks.  
Boots of Levitation  
Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement)  
While you wear these boots, you can cast Levitate  
on yourself.  
214 System Reference Document 5.2.1  
Boots of Speed  
Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement)  
While you wear these boots, you can take a Bonus  
Action to click the boots’ heels together. If you do,  
the boots double your Speed, and any creature that  
makes an Opportunity Attack against you has Disadvantage on the attack roll. If you click your heels  
together again, you end the effect.  
When you’ve used the boots’ property for a total  
of 10 minutes, the magic ceases to function for you  
until you finish a Long Rest.  
Boots of Striding and Springing  
Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)  
While you wear these boots, your Speed becomes  
30 feet unless your Speed is higher, and your Speed  
isn’t reduced by you carrying weight in excess of  
your carrying capacity or wearing Heavy Armor.  
Once on each of your turns, you can jump up to 30  
feet by spending only 10 feet of movement.  
Boots of the Winterlands  
Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)  
These furred boots are snug and feel warm. While  
wearing them, you gain the following benefits.  
Cold Resistance. You have Resistance to Cold  
damage and can tolerate temperatures of 0 degrees  
Fahrenheit or lower without any additional  
protection.  
Winter Strider. You ignore Difficult Terrain created by ice or snow.  
Bowl of Commanding Water Elementals  
Wondrous Item, Rare  
While this bowl is filled with water and you are  
within 5 feet of it, you can take a Magic action to  
summon a Water Elemental. The elemental appears in an unoccupied space as close to the bowl  
as possible, understands your languages, obeys  
your commands, and takes its turn immediately  
after you on your Initiative count. The elemental  
disappears after 1 hour, when it dies, or when you  
dismiss it as a Bonus Action. The bowl can’t be used  
this way again until the next dawn.  
The bowl is about 1 foot in diameter and half as  
deep. It holds about 3 gallons.  
Bracers of Archery  
Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)  
While wearing these bracers, you have proficiency  
with the Longbow and Shortbow, and you gain a +2  
bonus to damage rolls made with such weapons.  
Bracers of Defense  
Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement)  
While wearing these bracers, you gain a +2 bonus to  
Armor Class if you are wearing no armor and using  
no Shield.  
Brazier of Commanding Fire Elementals  
Wondrous Item, Rare  
While you are within 5 feet of this brazier, you can  
take a Magic action to summon a Fire Elemental.  
The elemental appears in an unoccupied space as  
close to the brazier as possible, understands your  
languages, obeys your commands, and takes its turn  
immediately after you on your Initiative count. The  
elemental disappears after 1 hour, when it dies, or  
when you dismiss it as a Bonus Action. The brazier  
can’t be used this way again until the next dawn.  
Brooch of Shielding  
Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)  
While wearing this brooch, you have Resistance to  
Force damage, and you have Immunity to damage  
from the Magic Missile spell.  
Broom of Flying  
Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)  
This wooden broom functions like a mundane  
broom until you stand astride it and take a Magic  
action to make it hover beneath you, at which time  
it can be ridden in the air. It has a Fly Speed of 50  
feet. It can carry up to 400 pounds, but its Fly Speed  
becomes 30 feet while carrying over 200 pounds.  
The broom stops hovering when you land or when  
you’re no longer riding it.  
As a Magic action, you can send the broom to  
travel alone to a destination within 1 mile of you if  
you name the location and are familiar with it. The  
broom comes back to you when you take a Magic  
action and use a command word if the broom is still  
within 1 mile of you.  
Candle of Invocation  
Wondrous Item, Very Rare (Requires Attunement)  
This candle’s magic is activated when the candle  
is lit, which requires a Magic action. After burning  
for 4 hours, the candle is destroyed. You can snuff  
it out early for use at a later time. Deduct the time  
it burned in increments of 1 minute from its total  
burn time.  
While lit, the candle sheds Dim Light in a 30-foot  
radius. While you are within that light, you have  
Advantage on D20 Tests. In addition, a Cleric or  
Druid in the light can cast level 1 spells they have  
prepared without expending spell slots.  
Alternatively, when you light the candle for the  
first time, you can cast Gate with it. Doing so destroys the candle. The portal created by the spell

Magic action. This property can’t be used again

to grip the cloak’s edges while flying in this way, or  
if you are no longer in Dim Light or Darkness, you  
lose this Fly Speed.  
While wearing the cloak in an area of Dim Light  
or Darkness, you can cast Polymorph on yourself,  
shape-shifting into a Bat. While in that form, you  
retain your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma  
scores. The cloak can’t be used this way again until  
the next dawn.

217 System Reference Document 5.2.1  
Dancing Sword  
Weapon (Greatsword, Longsword, Rapier, Scimitar, or  
Shortsword), Very Rare (Requires Attunement)  
You can take a Bonus Action to toss this magic  
weapon into the air. When you do so, the weapon  
begins to hover, flies up to 30 feet, and attacks one  
creature of your choice within 5 feet of itself. The  
weapon uses your attack roll and adds your ability  
modifier to damage rolls.  
While the weapon hovers, you can take a Bonus  
Action to cause it to fly up to 30 feet to another spot  
within 30 feet of you. As part of the same Bonus Action, you can cause the weapon to attack one creature within 5 feet of the weapon.  
After the hovering weapon attacks for the fourth  
time, it flies back to you and tries to return to your  
hand. If you have no hand free, the weapon falls to  
the ground in your space. If the weapon has no unobstructed path to you, it moves as close to you as  
it can and then falls to the ground. It also ceases to  
hover if you grasp it or are more than 30 feet away  
from it.  
Decanter of Endless Water  
Wondrous Item, Uncommon  
This stoppered flask sloshes when shaken, as if it  
contains water. The decanter weighs 2 pounds.  
You can take a Magic action to remove the stopper  
and issue one of three command words, whereupon  
an amount of fresh water or salt water (your choice)  
pours out of the flask. The water stops pouring out  
at the start of your next turn. Choose from the following command words:  
Splash. The decanter produces 1 gallon of water.  
Fountain. The decanter produces 5 gallons of water.  
Geyser. The decanter produces 30 gallons of water  
that gushes forth in a Line 30 feet long and 1 foot  
wide. If you’re holding the decanter, you can aim  
the geyser in one direction (no action required).  
One creature of your choice in the Line must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or take  
1d4 Bludgeoning damage and have the Prone condition. Instead of a creature, you can target one  
object in the Line that isn’t being worn or carried  
and that weighs no more than 200 pounds. The  
object is knocked over by the geyser.  
Deck of Illusions  
Wondrous Item, Uncommon  
This box contains a set of cards. A full deck has 34  
cards: 32 depicting specific creatures and two with  
a mirrored surface. A deck found as treasure is usually missing 1d20 - 1 cards.  
The magic of the deck functions only if its cards  
are drawn at random. You can take a Magic action  
to draw a card at random from the deck and throw  
it to the ground at a point within 30 feet of yourself.  
An illusion of a creature, determined by rolling on  
the Deck of Illusions table, forms over the thrown  
card and remains until dispelled. The illusory creature created by the card looks and behaves like a  
real creature of its kind, except that it can do no  
harm. While you are within 120 feet of the illusory  
creature and can see it, you can take a Magic action  
to move it anywhere within 30 feet of its card.  
Any physical interaction with the illusory creature reveals it to be false, because objects pass  
through it. A creature that takes a Study action to  
visually inspect the illusory creature identifies it as  
an illusion with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. The illusion lasts until its card  
is moved or the illusion is dispelled (using a Dispel  
Magic spell or a similar effect). When the illusion  
ends, the image on its card disappears, and that  
card can’t be used again.

Defender  
Weapon (Any Melee Weapon), Legendary (Requires  
Attunement)  
You gain a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls  
made with this magic weapon.  
The first time you attack with the weapon on each  
of your turns, you can transfer some or all of the  
weapon’s bonus to your Armor Class. For example,  
you could reduce the bonus to your attack rolls and  
damage rolls to +1 and gain a +2 bonus to Armor  
Class. The adjusted bonuses remain in effect until  
the start of your next turn, although you must hold  
the weapon to gain a bonus to AC from it.  
Demon Armor  
Armor (Any Light, Medium, or Heavy), Very Rare  
(Requires Attunement)  
While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to  
Armor Class, and you know Abyssal. In addition,  
the armor’s clawed gauntlets allow your Unarmed  
Strikes to deal 1d8 Slashing damage instead of the  
usual Bludgeoning damage, and you gain a +1 bonus  
to the attack and damage rolls of your Unarmed  
Strikes.  
Curse. Once you don this cursed armor, you can’t  
doff it unless you are targeted by a Remove Curse  
spell or similar magic. While wearing the armor,  
you have Disadvantage on attack rolls against demons and on saving throws against their spells and  
special abilities.  
Dimensional Shackles  
Wondrous Item, Rare  
You can take a Utilize action to place these shackles  
on a creature that has the Incapacitated condition.  
The shackles adjust to fit a creature of Small to  
Large size. The shackles prevent a creature bound  
by them from using any method of extradimensional movement, including teleportation or travel  
to a different plane of existence. They don’t prevent  
the creature from passing through an interdimensional portal.  
You and any creature you designate when you  
use the shackles can take a Utilize action to remove  
them. Once every 30 days, the bound creature can  
make a DC 30 Strength (Athletics) check. On a successful check, the creature breaks free and destroys  
the shackles.  
Dragon Orb  
Wondrous Item, Artifact (Requires Attunement)  
An orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in  
diameter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in  
diameter, and mist swirls inside it.  
While attuned to an orb, you can take a Magic  
action to peer into the orb’s depths. You must then  
make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, you control the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it. On a failed save, the orb imposes  
the Charmed condition on you for as long as you  
remain attuned to it.  
While you are Charmed by the orb, you can’t  
voluntarily end your Attunement to it, and the orb  
casts Suggestion on you at will (save DC 18), urging  
you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The  
dragon essence within the orb might want many  
things: the annihilation of a particular society or organization, freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the world, to advance the worship of Tiamat,  
or something else the GM decides.  
Spells. The orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3  
expended charges daily at dawn. If you control the  
orb, you can cast one of the spells on the following  
table from it. The table indicates how many charges  
you must expend to cast the spell.  

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Spell|Charge|
|Cost|
|Cure Wounds (level 9 version)|4|
|Daylight|1|
|Death Ward|2|
|Detect Magic|0|
|Scrying (save DC 18)|3|

Call Dragons. While you control the orb, you  
can take a Magic action to cause the orb to issue a  
telepathic call that extends in all directions for 40  
miles. Chromatic dragons in range feel compelled  
to come to the orb as soon as possible by the most  
direct route. Dragon deities such as Tiamat are unaffected by this call. Chromatic dragons drawn to  
the orb might be Hostile toward you for compelling  
them against their will. Once you have used this  
property, it can’t be used again for 1 hour.  
Destroying an Orb. A Dragon Orb has AC 20 and is  
destroyed if it takes damage from a +3 Weapon or a  
Disintegrate spell. Nothing else can harm it.  
Dragon Scale Mail  
Armor (Scale Mail), Very Rare (Requires Attunement)  
Dragon Scale Mail is made of the scales of one kind  
of dragon. Sometimes dragons collect their cast-off  
219 System Reference Document 5.2.1  
scales and gift them. Other times, hunters carefully  
preserve the hide of a dead dragon. In either case,  
Dragon Scale Mail is highly valued.  
While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to  
Armor Class, you have Advantage on saving throws  
against the breath weapons of Dragons, and you  
have Resistance to one damage type determined by  
the kind of dragon that provided the scales (see the  
accompanying table).  
Additionally, you can focus your senses as a Magic  
action to discern the distance and direction to the  
closest dragon within 30 miles of yourself that is  
of the same type as the armor. This action can’t be  
used again until the next dawn.  

|   |   |   |   |

|Dragon|Resistance|Dragon|Resistance|
|Black|Acid|Gold|Fire|
|Blue|Lightning|Green|Poison|
|Brass|Fire|Red|Fire|

Dragon Slayer  
Weapon (Any Simple or Martial), Rare  
You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls  
made with this magic weapon.  
The weapon deals an extra 3d6 damage of the  
weapon’s type if the target is a Dragon.  
Dust of Disappearance  
Wondrous Item, Uncommon  
This powder resembles fine sand. There is enough  
of it for one use. When you take a Utilize action to  
throw the dust into the air, you and each creature  
and object within a 10-foot Emanation originating  
from you have the Invisible condition for 2d4 minutes. The duration is the same for all subjects, and  
the dust is consumed when its magic takes effect.  
Immediately after an affected creature makes an attack roll, deals damage, or casts a spell, the Invisible  
condition ends for that creature.  
Dust of Dryness  
Wondrous Item, Uncommon  
This small packet contains 1d6 + 4 pinches of dust.  
As a Utilize action, you can sprinkle a pinch of the  
dust over water, turning up to a 15-foot Cube of  
water into one marble-sized pellet, which floats  
or rests near where the dust was sprinkled. The  
pellet’s weight is negligible. A creature can take  
a Utilize action to smash the pellet against a hard  
surface, causing the pellet to shatter and release the  
water the dust absorbed. Doing so destroys the pellet and ends its magic.  
As a Utilize action, you can sprinkle a pinch of the  
dust on an Elemental within 5 feet of yourself that  
is composed mostly of water (such as a Water Elemental). Such a creature exposed to a pinch of the  
dust makes a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 10d6 Necrotic damage on a failed save or half as  
much damage on a successful one.  
Dust of Sneezing and Choking  
Wondrous Item, Uncommon  
Found in a small container, this powder resembles  
Dust of Disappearance, and Identify reveals it to be  
such. There is enough of it for one use.  
As a Utilize action, you can throw the dust into the  
air, forcing yourself and every creature in a 30-foot  
Emanation originating from you to make a DC 15  
Constitution saving throw. Constructs, Elementals,  
Oozes, Plants, and Undead succeed on the save  
automatically.  
On a failed save, a creature begins sneezing uncontrollably; it has the Incapacitated condition and  
is suffocating. The creature repeats the save at the  
end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on  
a success. The effect also ends on any creature targeted by a Lesser Restoration spell.  
Dwarven Plate  
Armor (Half Plate Armor or Plate Armor), Very Rare  
While wearing this armor, you gain a +2 bonus to  
Armor Class. In addition, if an effect moves you  
against your will along the ground, you can take a  
Reaction to reduce the distance you are moved by  
up to 10 feet.  
Dwarven Thrower  
Weapon (Warhammer), Very Rare (Requires  
Attunement by a Dwarf or a Creature Attuned to a Belt  
of Dwarvenkind)  
You gain a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls  
made with this magic weapon. It has the Thrown  
property with a normal range of 20 feet and a long  
range of 60 feet. When you hit with a ranged attack  
using this weapon, it deals an extra 1d8 Force damage, or an extra 2d8 Force damage if the target is  
a Giant. Immediately after hitting or missing, the  
weapon flies back to your hand.  
Efficient Quiver  
Wondrous Item, Uncommon  
Each of the quiver’s three compartments connects  
to an extradimensional space that allows the quiver  
to hold numerous items while never weighing more  
than 2 pounds. The shortest compartment can hold  
up to 60 Arrows, Bolts, or similar objects. The midsize compartment holds up to 18 Javelins or similar  
objects. The longest compartment holds up to 6 long  
objects, such as bows, Quarterstaffs, or Spears.  
You can draw any item the quiver contains as if  
doing so from a regular quiver or scabbard.  
220 System Reference Document 5.2.1  
Efreeti Bottle  
Wondrous Item, Very Rare  
When you take a Magic action to remove the stopper  
of this painted brass bottle, a cloud of thick smoke  
flows out of it. At the end of your turn, the smoke disappears with a flash of harmless fire, and an Efreeti  
appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.  
The first time the bottle is opened, the GM rolls on  
the following table to determine what happens.  

|   |   |
|---|---|
|1d10  <br>1|Effect  <br>The efreeti attacks you. After fighting for 5  <br>rounds, the efreeti disappears, and the bottle  <br>loses its magic.  <br>The efreeti understands your languages and|
|2–9|

obeys your commands for 1 hour, after which  
it returns to the bottle, and a new stopper  
contains it. The stopper can’t be removed for  
24 hours. The next two times the bottle is  
opened, the same effect occurs. If the bottle is  
opened a fourth time, the efreeti escapes and  
disappears, and the bottle loses its magic.  
10 The efreeti understands your languages and can  
cast Wish once for you. It disappears when it  
grants the wish or after 1 hour, and the bottle  
loses its magic.  
Elemental Gem  
Wondrous Item, Uncommon  
This gem contains a mote of elemental energy.  
When you take a Utilize action to break the gem,  
an elemental is summoned (see “Monsters” for its  
stat block), and the gem ceases to be magical. The  
elemental appears in an unoccupied space as close  
to the broken gem as possible, understands your  
languages, obeys your commands, and takes its  
turn immediately after you on your Initiative count.  
The elemental disappears after 1 hour, when it dies,  
or when you dismiss it as a Bonus Action. The type  
of gem determines the elemental, as shown in the  
following table.  

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Gem|Summoned Elemental|
|Blue sapphire|Air Elemental|
|Emerald|Water Elemental|
|Red corundum|Fire Elemental|
|Yellow diamond|Earth Elemental|

Elixir of Health  
Potion, Rare  
When you drink this potion, you are cured of all  
magical contagions. In addition, the following conditions end on you: Blinded, Deafened, Paralyzed,  
and Poisoned.  
The clear, red liquid has tiny bubbles of light in it.  
Elven Chain  
Armor (Chain Mail or Chain Shirt), Rare

this armor. You are considered trained with this armor even if you lack training with Medium or Heavy  
armor.  
Energy Bow  
Weapon (Longbow or Shortbow), Very Rare (Requires  
Attunement)  
You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls  
made with this magic weapon, which has no string.  
Each time you pull your arm back in a firing motion,  
a magical arrow made of golden energy appears  
nocked and ready to fire. An arrow produced by  
this weapon deals Force damage instead of Piercing damage on a hit, and it disappears after it hits  
or misses its target. Until it disappears, the arrow  
emits Bright Light in a 20-foot radius and Dim Light  
for an additional 20 feet.  
This weapon has the following additional  
properties.  
Arrow of Restraint. Whenever you use this  
weapon to make a ranged attack against a creature,  
you can try to restrain the target instead of dealing damage to it. If the arrow hits, the target must  
succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or have  
the Restrained condition for 1 minute. As an action,  
a creature Restrained by an arrow can make a DC  
20 Strength (Athletics) check to try to break the  
restraint, ending the effect on itself on a successful  
check.  
Arrow of Transport. As a Magic action, you can  
fire one energy arrow from this weapon at a target  
you can see within 60 feet of yourself. The target  
can be either a willing Medium or smaller creature  
or an object that isn’t being worn or carried, provided the object is small enough to fit inside a 5-foot  
Cube. The arrow teleports the target to an unoccupied space you can see within 10 feet of you.  
Energy Ladder. As a Magic action, you can loose a  
flurry of energy arrows from this weapon at a wall  
up to 60 feet away from yourself. The arrows become glowing rungs that stick out of the wall, forming a magical ladder up to 60 feet long on the wall.  
This ladder lasts for 1 minute before disappearing.  
Eversmoking Bottle  
Wondrous Item, Uncommon  
As a Magic action, you can open or close this bottle.  
Opening the bottle causes thick smoke to billow  
out, forming a cloud that fills a 60-foot Emanation  
originating from the bottle. The area within the  
smoke is Heavily Obscured.  
Each minute the bottle remains open, the size of  
the Emanation increases by 10 feet until it reaches  
its maximum size of 120 feet.  
221 System Reference Document 5.2.1  
Closing the bottle causes the cloud to become  
fixed in place until it disperses after 10 minutes.  
A strong wind (such as that created by the Gust of  
Wind spell) disperses the cloud after 1 minute.  
Eyes of Charming  
Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)  
These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. They have  
3 charges. While wearing them, you can expend  
1 or more charges to cast Charm Person (save DC  
13). For 1 charge, you cast the level 1 version of the  
spell. You increase the spell’s level by one for each  
additional charge you expend. The lenses regain all  
expended charges daily at dawn.  
Eyes of Minute Seeing  
Wondrous Item, Uncommon  
These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. While wearing them, your vision improves significantly out to a  
range of 1 foot, granting you Darkvision within that  
range and Advantage on Intelligence (Investigation)  
checks made to examine something within that  
range.  
Eyes of the Eagle  
Wondrous Item, Uncommon  
These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. While wearing them, you have Advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. In conditions of  
clear visibility, you can make out details of even  
extremely distant creatures and objects as small as  
2 feet across.  
Feather Token  
Wondrous Item, Rarity Varies  
This object looks like a feather. Different types of  
feather tokens exist, each with a different single-use  
effect. The GM chooses the kind of token or determines it randomly by rolling on the Feather Tokens  
table. The type of token determines its rarity.  
Anchor (Uncommon). You can take a Magic action  
to touch the token to a boat or ship. For the next  
24 hours, the vessel can’t be moved by any means.  
Touching the token to the vessel again ends the effect. When the effect ends, the token disappears.  
Bird (Rare). You can take a Magic action to toss  
the token 5 feet into the air. The token disappears  
and an enormous, multicolored bird takes its place.  
The bird has the statistics of a Roc, but it can’t attack. It obeys your simple commands and can carry  
up to 500 pounds while flying at its maximum  
speed (16 miles per hour for a maximum of 144  
miles per day, with a 1-hour rest for every 3 hours of  
flying) or 1,000 pounds at half that speed. The bird  
disappears after flying its maximum distance for a  
day or if it drops to 0 Hit Points. You can dismiss the  
bird as a Magic action.  
Fan (Uncommon). If you are on a boat or ship,  
you can take a Magic action to toss the token up to  
10 feet in the air. The token disappears, and a giant  
flapping fan takes its place. The fan floats and creates a strong wind. This wind can fill the sails of one  
ship, increasing its speed by 5 miles per hour for 8  
hours. You can dismiss the fan as a Magic action.  
Swan Boat (Rare). You can take a Magic action to  
touch the token to a body of water at least 60 feet  
in diameter. The token disappears, and a 50-footlong, 20-foot-wide boat shaped like a swan takes its  
place. The boat is self-propelled and moves across  
water at a speed of 6 miles per hour. You can take  
a Magic action while on the boat to command it to  
move or to turn up to 90 degrees. The boat remains  
for 24 hours and then disappears. You can dismiss  
the boat as a Magic action.  
Tree (Uncommon). You must be outdoors to use  
this token. You can take a Magic action to touch it  
to an unoccupied space on the ground. The token  
disappears, and in its place a nonmagical oak tree  
springs into existence. The tree is 60 feet tall and  
has a 5-foot-diameter trunk, and its branches at the  
top spread out in a 20-foot radius.  
Whip (Rare). You can take a Magic action to  
throw the token to a point within 10 feet of yourself.  
The token disappears, and a floating whip takes its  
place. You can then take a Bonus Action to make a  
melee spell attack against a creature within 10 feet  
of the whip, with an attack bonus of +9. On a hit, the  
target takes 1d6 + 5 Force damage.  
As a Bonus Action, you can direct the whip to fly  
up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature  
within 10 feet of the whip. The whip disappears after  
1 hour, when you take a Magic action to dismiss it, or  
when you die or have the Incapacitated condition.

Figurine of Wondrous Power  
Wondrous Item, Rarity Varies  
A Figurine of Wondrous Power is a statuette small  
enough to fit in a pocket. If you take a Magic action to throw the figurine to a point on the ground  
within 60 feet of yourself, the figurine becomes a  
living creature specified in the figurine’s description below. If the space where the creature would  
appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or  
222 System Reference Document 5.2.1  
if there isn’t enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn’t become a creature.  
The creature is Friendly to you and your allies.  
It understands your languages, obeys your commands, and takes its turn immediately after you on  
your Initiative count. If you issue no commands, the  
creature defends itself but takes no other actions.  
The creature exists for a duration specific to each  
figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature  
reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine  
early if its creature form drops to 0 Hit Points or if  
you take a Magic action while touching the creature  
to make it revert to figurine form. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can’t  
be used again until a certain amount of time has  
passed, as specified in the figurine’s description.  
Bronze Griffon (Rare). This bronze statuette is of  
a griffon rampant. It can become a Griffon for up to  
6 hours. Once it has been used, it can’t be used again  
until 5 days have passed.  
Ebony Fly (Rare). This ebony statuette, carved in  
the likeness of a horsefly, can become a Giant Fly  
(see the accompanying stat block) for up to 12 hours  
and can be ridden as a mount. Once it has been used,  
it can’t be used again until 2 days have passed.

Golden Lions (Rare). These gold statuettes of  
lions are always created in pairs. You can use one  
figurine or both simultaneously. Each can become  
a Lion for up to 1 hour. Once a lion has been used, it  
can’t be used again until 7 days have passed.  
Ivory Goats (Rare). These ivory statuettes of  
goats are always created in sets of three. Each goat  
looks unique and functions differently from the others. Their properties are as follows:  
Goat of Terror. This figurine can become a Giant  
Goat for up to 3 hours. The goat can’t attack, but  
you can (harmlessly) remove its horns and use  
them as weapons. One horn becomes a +1 Lance,  
and the other becomes a +2 Longsword. Removing  
a horn requires a Magic action, and the weapons  
disappear and the horns return when the goat  
reverts to figurine form. While you ride the goat,  
any Hostile creature that starts its turn within  
a 30-foot Emanation originating from the goat  
must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or  
have the Frightened condition for 1 minute, until  
you are no longer riding the goat, or until the goat  
reverts to figurine form. The Frightened creature  
repeats the save at the end of each of its turns,  
ending the effect on itself on a success. Once it  
succeeds on the save, a creature is immune to  
this effect for the next 24 hours. Once the figurine  
has been used, it can’t be used again until 15 days  
have passed.  
Goat of Traveling. This figurine can become a  
Large goat with the same statistics as a Riding  
Horse. It has 24 charges, and each hour or portion thereof it spends in goat form costs 1 charge.  
While it has charges, you can use it as often as you  
wish. When it runs out of charges, it reverts to a  
figurine and can’t be used again until 7 days have  
passed, when it regains all expended charges.  
Goat of Travail. This figurine can become a Giant  
Goat for up to 3 hours. Once it has been used, it  
can’t be used again until 30 days have passed.  
Marble Elephant (Rare). This marble statuette  
resembles a trumpeting elephant. It can become an  
Elephant for up to 24 hours. Once it has been used,  
it can’t be used again until 7 days have passed.  
Obsidian Steed (Very Rare). This polished obsidian horse can become a Nightmare for up to 24  
hours. The nightmare fights only to defend itself.  
Once it has been used, it can’t be used again until 5  
days have passed.  
The figurine has a 10 percent chance each time  
you use it to ignore your orders, including a command to revert to figurine form. If you mount the  
nightmare while it is ignoring your orders, you  
and the nightmare are instantly transported to a  
random location on the plane of Hades, where the  
nightmare reverts to figurine form.  
Onyx Dog (Rare). This onyx statuette of a dog can  
become a Mastiff for up to 6 hours. The mastiff has  
an Intelligence of 8 and can speak Common. It also  
has Blindsight with a range of 60 feet. Once it has  
been used, it can’t be used again until 7 days have  
passed.  
Serpentine Owl (Rare). This serpentine statuette  
of an owl can become a Giant Owl for up to 8 hours.  
The owl can communicate telepathically with you at  
any range if you and it are on the same plane of existence. Once it has been used, it can’t be used again  
until 2 days have passed.  
Silver Raven (Uncommon). This silver statuette  
of a raven can become a Raven for up to 12 hours.  
Once it has been used, it can’t be used again until 2  
days have passed. While in raven form, the figurine  
grants you the ability to cast Animal Messenger on it.  
223 System Reference Document 5.2.1  
Flame Tongue  
Weapon (Any Melee Weapon), Rare (Requires  
Attunement)  
While holding this magic weapon, you can take a  
Bonus Action and use a command word to cause  
flames to engulf the damage-dealing part of the  
weapon. These flames shed Bright Light in a 40-  
foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 40 feet.  
While the weapon is ablaze, it deals an extra 2d6  
Fire damage on a hit. The flames last until you take  
a Bonus Action to issue the command again or until  
you drop, stow, or sheathe the weapon.  
Folding Boat  
Wondrous Item, Rare  
This object appears as a wooden box that measures  
12 inches long, 6 inches wide, and 6 inches deep.  
It weighs 4 pounds and floats. It can be opened to  
store items inside. This item also has three command words, each requiring a Magic action to use:  
First Command Word. The box unfolds into a  
Rowboat.  
Second Command Word. The box unfolds into a  
Keelboat.  
Third Command Word. The Folding Boat folds back  
into a box if no creatures are aboard. Any objects  
in the vessel that can’t fit inside the box remain  
outside the box as it folds. Any objects in the vessel that can fit inside the box do so.  
When the box becomes a vessel, its weight becomes  
that of a normal vessel its size, and anything that  
was stored in the box remains in the boat.  
Statistics for the Rowboat and Keelboat appear  
in “Equipment.” If either vessel is reduced to 0 Hit  
Points, the Folding Boat is destroyed.  
Frost Brand  
Weapon (Glaive, Greatsword, Longsword, Rapier,  
Scimitar, or Shortsword), Very Rare (Requires  
Attunement)

This prism has 50 charges. While you are holding  
it, you can take a Magic action and use one of three  
command words to cause one of the following  
effects:  
First Command Word. The gem sheds Bright Light  
in a 30-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional  
30 feet. This effect doesn’t expend a charge. It  
lasts until you take a Bonus Action to repeat the  
command word or until you use another function  
of the gem.  
Second Command Word. You expend 1 charge and  
cause the gem to fire a brilliant beam of light at  
one creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have the Blinded condition  
for 1 minute. The creature repeats the save at the  
end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself  
on a success.  
Third Command Word. You expend 5 charges and  
cause the gem to flare with intense light in a 30-  
foot Cone. Each creature in the Cone makes a saving throw as if struck by the beam created with  
the second command word.  
When all of the gem’s charges are expended, the  
gem becomes a nonmagical jewel worth 50 GP.  
Gem of Seeing  
Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement)  
This gem has 3 charges. As a Magic action, you can

cause the armor to assume the appearance of a normal set of clothing or some other kind of armor. You  
decide what it looks like—including color, style, and  
accessories—but the armor retains its normal bulk  
and weight. The illusory appearance lasts until you  
use this property again or doff the armor.  
Gloves of Missile Snaring  
Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)  
If you’re hit by an attack roll made with a Ranged  
or Thrown weapon while wearing these gloves, you  
can take a Reaction to reduce the damage by 1d10

If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the ammunition or weapon if it is small enough for you to  
hold in that hand.

You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls  
made with this magic weapon.

creature within 30 feet of it other than you must  
succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or

your Belt of Giant Strength or Gauntlets of Ogre  
Power increases by 4, to a maximum of 30.  
Handy Haversack  
Wondrous Item, Rare  
This backpack has a central pouch and two side  
pouches, each of which is an extradimensional  
space. Each side pouch can hold up to 200 pounds  
of material, not exceeding a volume of 25 cubic feet.  
The central pouch can hold up to 500 pounds of material, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The  
haversack always weighs 5 pounds, regardless of its  
contents.  
Retrieving an item from the haversack requires a  
Utilize action or a Bonus Action (your choice). When  
you reach into the haversack for a specific item, the  
item is always magically on top.  
If any of its pouches is overloaded, pierced, or  
torn, the haversack ruptures and is destroyed. If the  
haversack is destroyed, its contents are lost forever,  
although an Artifact always turns up again somewhere. If the haversack is turned inside out, its contents spill forth unharmed, and the haversack must  
be put right before it can be used again.  
Each pouch of the haversack holds enough air for  
10 minutes of breathing, divided by the number of  
breathing creatures inside.  
Placing the haversack inside an extradimensional  
space created by a Bag of Holding, Portable Hole,  
or similar item instantly destroys both items and  
opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates  
where the one item was placed inside the other. Any  
creature within 10 feet of the gate and not behind  
Total Cover is sucked through it and deposited in  
a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate  
then closes. The gate is one-way only and can’t be  
reopened.  
Hat of Disguise

While wearing this hat, you can cast the Disguise  
Self spell. The spell ends if the hat is removed.  
Hat of Many Spells  
Wondrous Item, Very Rare (Requires Attunement by a  
Wizard)  
This pointed hat has the following properties.  
Spellcasting Focus. While holding the hat, you  
can use it as a Spellcasting Focus for your Wizard  
spells. Any spell you cast using the hat gains a special Somatic component: you must reach into the hat  
and “pull” the spell out of it.  
225 System Reference Document 5.2.1  
Unknown Spell. While holding the hat, you can  
try to cast a level 1+ spell you don’t know. The spell  
must be on the Wizard spell list, it must be of a level  
you can cast, and it can’t have Material components  
costing more than 1,000 GP. Once you decide on  
the spell, you must expend a spell slot of the spell’s  
level. Then, to determine whether you cast the spell,  
make an Intelligence (Arcana) check (DC 10 plus  
the spell’s level). On a successful check, you cast the  
spell using its normal casting time, and you can’t  
use this property again until you finish a Short or  
Long Rest. On a failed check, you fail to cast the  
spell and a random effect occurs instead, determined by rolling on the following table.  
Any spell you cast from the hat uses your spell  
save DC and spell attack bonus.

unoccupied space within 30 feet of you and  
remains open until the end of your next turn.  
The GM determines where it leads.

1d6 to determine the item’s rarity: on a 1–3,

destroyed before then.  
Headband of Intellect  
Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)  
Your Intelligence is 19 while you wear this headband. It has no effect on you if your Intelligence is  
19 or higher without it.  
Helm of Brilliance  
Wondrous Item, Very Rare (Requires Attunement)  
This helm is set with 1d10 diamonds, 2d10 rubies,  
3d10 fire opals, and 4d10 opals. Any gem pried from  
the helm crumbles to dust. When all the gems are

one fire opal, you can take a Magic action to cause  
one weapon you are holding to burst into flames.  
The flames emit Bright Light in a 10-foot radius and  
Dim Light for an additional 10 feet. The flames are  
harmless to you and the weapon. When you hit with  
an attack using the blazing weapon, the target takes  
an extra 1d6 Fire damage. The flames last until you  
take a Bonus Action to extinguish them or until you  
drop or stow the weapon.  
Ruby Resistance. As long as the helm has at least  
one ruby, you have Resistance to Fire damage.  
Spells. You can cast one of the following spells  
(save DC 18), using one of the helm’s gems of the  
specified type as a component: Daylight (opal), Fireball (fire opal), Prismatic Spray (diamond), or Wall of  
Fire (ruby). The gem is destroyed when the spell is  
cast and disappears from the helm.  
Taking Fire Damage. Roll 1d20 if you are wearing  
the helm and take Fire damage as a result of failing  
226 System Reference Document 5.2.1  
a saving throw against a spell. On a roll of 1, the  
helm emits beams of light from its remaining gems  
and is then destroyed. Each creature within a 60-  
foot Emanation originating from you must succeed  
on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be struck by a  
beam, taking Radiant damage equal to the number  
of gems in the helm.  
Helm of Comprehending Languages  
Wondrous Item, Uncommon  
While wearing this helm, you can cast Comprehend  
Languages from it.  
Helm of Telepathy  
Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)  
While wearing this helm, you have telepathy with a  
range of 30 feet, and you can cast Detect Thoughts  
or Suggestion (save DC 13) from the helm. Once either spell is cast from the helm, that spell can’t be  
cast from it again until the next dawn.  
Helm of Teleportation  
Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement)  
This helm has 3 charges. While wearing it, you can  
expend 1 charge to cast Teleport from it. The helm  
regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.  
Holy Avenger  
Weapon (Any Simple or Martial), Legendary (Requires  
Attunement by a Paladin)  
You gain a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls  
made with this magic weapon. When you hit a Fiend  
or an Undead with it, that creature takes an extra  
2d10 Radiant damage.  
While you hold the drawn weapon, it creates a  
10-foot Emanation originating from you. You and all  
creatures Friendly to you in the Emanation have Advantage on saving throws against spells and other  
magical effects. If you have 17 or more levels in the  
Paladin class, the size of the Emanation increases to  
30 feet.  
Horn of Blasting  
Wondrous Item, Rare  
You can take a Magic action to blow the horn, which  
emits a thunderous blast in a 30-foot Cone that is  
audible out to 600 feet. Each creature in the Cone  
makes a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a  
failed save, a creature takes 5d8 Thunder damage  
and has the Deafened condition for 1 minute. On a  
successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only. Glass or crystal objects in the Cone that  
aren’t being worn or carried take 10d8 Thunder  
damage.  
Each use of the horn’s magic has a 20 percent  
chance of causing the horn to explode. The explosion deals 10d6 Force damage to the user and  
destroys the horn.  
Horn of Valhalla  
Wondrous Item, Rare (Silver or Brass), Very Rare  
(Bronze), or Legendary (Iron)  
You can take a Magic action to blow this horn. In  
response, warrior spirits from the plane of Ysgard  
appear in unoccupied spaces within 60 feet of you.  
Each spirit uses the Berserker stat block and returns to Ysgard after 1 hour or when it drops to 0  
Hit Points. The spirits look like living, breathing  
warriors, and they have Immunity to the Charmed  
and Frightened conditions. Once you use the horn, it  
can’t be used again until 7 days have passed.  
Four types of Horn of Valhalla are known to exist, each made of a different metal. The horn’s type  
determines how many spirits it summons, as well  
as the requirement for its use. The GM chooses the  
horn’s type or determines it randomly by rolling on  
the following table.  
If you blow the horn without meeting its requirement, the summoned spirits attack you. If you meet  
the requirement, they are Friendly to you and your  
allies and follow your commands.  

|   |   |   |   |

Horseshoes of a Zephyr  
Wondrous Item, Very Rare  
These horseshoes come in a set of four. As a Magic  
action, you can touch one of the horseshoes to the  
hoof of a horse or similar creature, whereupon the  
horseshoe affixes itself to the hoof. Removing a  
horseshoe also takes a Magic action.  
While all four shoes are affixed to the hooves of a  
horse or similar creature, they allow the creature  
to move normally while floating 4 inches above a  
surface. This effect means the creature can cross  
or stand above nonsolid or unstable surfaces, such  
as water or lava. The creature leaves no tracks and  
ignores Difficult Terrain. In addition, the creature  
can travel for up to 12 hours a day without gaining  
Exhaustion levels from extended travel.  
227 System Reference Document 5.2.1  
Horseshoes of Speed  
Wondrous Item, Rare  
These horseshoes come in a set of four. As a Magic  
action, you can touch one of the horseshoes to the  
hoof of a horse or similar creature, whereupon the  
horseshoe affixes itself to the hoof. Removing a  
horseshoe also takes a Magic action.  
While all four horseshoes are attached to the  
same creature, its Speed is increased by 30 feet.  
Immovable Rod  
Rod, Uncommon  
This iron rod has a button on one end. You can take  
a Utilize action to press the button, which causes  
the rod to become magically fixed in place. Until you  
or another creature takes a Utilize action to push  
the button again, the rod doesn’t move, even if it  
defies gravity. The rod can hold up to 8,000 pounds  
of weight. More weight causes the rod to deactivate  
and fall. A creature can take a Utilize action to make  
a DC 30 Strength (Athletics) check, moving the fixed  
rod up to 10 feet on a successful check.  
Instant Fortress  
Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement)  
As a Magic action, you can place this 1-inch  
adamantine statuette on the ground and, using  
a command word, cause it to grow rapidly into a  
square adamantine tower. Repeating the command  
word causes the tower to revert to statuette form,  
which works only if the tower is empty. Each creature in the area where the tower appears is pushed  
to an unoccupied space outside but next to the  
tower. Objects in the area that aren’t being worn or  
carried are also pushed clear of the tower.  
The tower is 20 feet on a side and 30 feet high,  
with arrow slits on all sides and a battlement atop  
it. Its interior is divided into two floors, with a ladder, staircase, or ramp (your choice) connecting  
them. This ladder, staircase, or ramp ends at a trapdoor leading to the roof. When created, the tower  
has a single door at ground level on the side facing  
you. The door opens only at your command, which  
you can issue as a Bonus Action. It is immune to the  
Knock spell and similar magic.  
Magic prevents the tower from being tipped over.  
The roof, the door, and the walls each have AC 20;  
HP 100; Immunity to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and  
Slashing damage except that which is dealt by siege  
equipment; and Resistance to all other damage.  
Shrinking the tower back down to statuette form  
doesn’t repair damage to the tower. Only a Wish  
spell can repair the tower (this use of the spell  
counts as replicating a spell of level 8 or lower).  
Each casting of Wish causes the tower to regain all  
its Hit Points.  
Ioun Stone  
Wondrous Item, Rarity Varies (Requires Attunement)  
Roughly marble sized, Ioun Stones are named after  
Ioun, a god of knowledge and prophecy revered on  
some worlds. Many types of Ioun Stones exist, each  
type a distinct combination of shape and color.  
When you take a Magic action to toss an Ioun  
Stone into the air, the stone orbits your head at a  
distance of 1d3 feet, conferring its benefit to you  
while doing so. You can have up to three Ioun Stones  
orbiting your head at the same time.  
Each Ioun Stone orbiting your head is considered  
to be an object you are wearing. The orbiting stone  
avoids contact with other creatures and objects, adjusting its orbit to avoid collisions and thwarting all  
attempts by other creatures to attack or snatch it.  
As a Utilize action, you can seize and stow any  
number of Ioun Stones orbiting your head. If your  
Attunement to an Ioun Stone ends while it’s orbiting your head, the stone falls as though you had  
dropped it.  
The type of stone determines its rarity and  
effects.  
Absorption (Very Rare). While this pale lavender  
ellipsoid orbits your head, you can take a Reaction  
to cancel a spell of level 4 or lower cast by a creature you can see. A canceled spell has no effect, and  
any resources used to cast it are wasted. Once the  
stone has canceled 20 levels of spells, it burns out,  
turns dull gray, and loses its magic.  
Agility (Very Rare). Your Dexterity increases by  
2, to a maximum of 20, while this deep-red sphere  
orbits your head.  
Awareness (Rare). While this dark-blue rhomboid  
orbits your head, you have Advantage on Initiative  
rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks.  
Fortitude (Very Rare). Your Constitution increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this pink  
rhomboid orbits your head.  
Greater Absorption (Legendary). While this marbled lavender and green ellipsoid orbits your head,  
you can take a Reaction to cancel a spell of level 8  
or lower cast by a creature you can see. A canceled  
spell has no effect, and any resources used to cast  
it are wasted. Once the stone has canceled 20 levels of spells, it burns out, turns dull gray, and loses  
its magic.  
Insight (Very Rare). Your Wisdom increases by  
2, to a maximum of 20, while this incandescent blue  
sphere orbits your head.  
Intellect (Very Rare). Your Intelligence increases  
by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this marbled scarlet  
and blue sphere orbits your head.  
Leadership (Very Rare). Your Charisma increases  
by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this marbled pink  
and green sphere orbits your head.  
228 System Reference Document 5.2.1  
Mastery (Legendary). Your Proficiency Bonus increases by 1 while this pale green prism orbits your  
head.  
Protection (Rare). You gain a +1 bonus to Armor  
Class while this dusty-rose prism orbits your head.  
Regeneration (Legendary). You regain 15 Hit  
Points at the end of each hour this pearly white  
spindle orbits your head if you have at least 1 Hit  
Point.  
Reserve (Rare). This vibrant purple prism stores  
spells cast into it, holding them until you use them.  
The stone can store up to 4 levels of spells at a time.  
When found, it contains 1d4 levels of stored spells  
chosen by the GM.  
Any creature can cast a spell of level 1 through 4  
into the stone by touching it as the spell is cast. The  
spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the  
stone. If the stone can’t hold the spell, the spell is  
expended without effect. The level of the slot used  
to cast the spell determines how much space it uses.  
While this stone orbits your head, you can cast  
any spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level,  
spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster but is otherwise  
treated as if you cast the spell. The spell cast from  
the stone is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.  
Strength (Very Rare). Your Strength increases by  
2, to a maximum of 20, while this pale blue rhomboid orbits your head.  
Sustenance (Rare). You don’t need to eat or drink  
while this clear spindle orbits your head.  
Iron Bands  
Wondrous Item, Rare  
This rusty iron sphere measures 3 inches in diameter and weighs 1 pound. You can take a Magic action  
to throw the sphere at a Huge or smaller creature  
you can see within 60 feet of yourself. As the sphere  
moves through the air, it opens into a tangle of  
metal bands.  
Make a ranged attack roll with an attack bonus  
equal to your Dexterity modifier plus your Proficiency Bonus. On a hit, the target has the Restrained  
condition until you take a Bonus Action to issue a  
command that releases it. Doing so or missing with  
the attack causes the bands to contract and become  
a sphere once more.  
A creature that can touch the bands, including the  
one Restrained, can take an action to make a DC 20  
Strength (Athletics) check to break the iron bands.  
On a successful check, the item is destroyed, and the  
Restrained creature is freed. On a failed check, any  
further attempts made by that creature automatically fail until 24 hours have elapsed.  
Once the bands are used, they can’t be used again  
until the next dawn.  
Iron Flask  
Wondrous Item, Legendary  
While holding this brass-stoppered iron flask, you  
can take a Magic action to target a creature that  
you can see within 60 feet of yourself. If the flask  
is empty and the target is native to a plane of existence other than the one you’re on, the target must  
succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be  
trapped in the flask. If the target has been trapped  
by the flask before, it has Advantage on the save.  
Once trapped, a creature remains in the flask until  
released. The flask can hold only one creature at a  
time. A creature trapped in the flask doesn’t age and  
doesn’t need to breathe, eat, or drink.  
You can take a Magic action to remove the flask’s  
stopper and release the creature in the flask. The  
creature then obeys your commands for 1 hour,  
understanding those commands even if it doesn’t  
know the language in which the commands are  
given. If you issue no commands or give the creature a command that is likely to result in its death  
or imprisonment, it defends itself but otherwise  
takes no actions. At the end of the duration, the  
creature acts in accordance with its normal disposition and alignment.  
An Identify spell reveals if the flask contains a  
creature, but the only way to determine the type  
of creature is to open the flask. A newly discovered  
Iron Flask might already contain a creature chosen  
by the GM.  
Javelin of Lightning  
Weapon (Javelin), Uncommon  
Each time you make an attack roll with this magic  
weapon and hit, you can have it deal Lightning damage instead of Piercing damage.  
Lightning Bolt. When you throw this weapon at  
a target no farther than 120 feet from you, you can  
forgo making a ranged attack roll and instead turn  
the weapon into a bolt of lightning. This bolt forms  
a 5-foot-wide Line between you and the target. The  
target and each other creature in the Line (excluding you) makes a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 Lightning damage on a failed save or half  
as much damage on a successful one. Immediately  
after dealing this damage, the weapon reappears in  
your hand. This property can’t be used again until  
the next dawn.  
Lantern of Revealing  
Wondrous Item, Uncommon  
While lit, this hooded lantern burns for 6 hours on 1  
pint of oil, shedding Bright Light in a 30-foot radius  
and Dim Light for an additional 30 feet. Invisible  
creatures and objects are visible as long as they are  
in the lantern’s Bright Light. You can take a Utilize  
229 System Reference Document 5.2.1  
action to lower the hood, reducing the lantern’s light  
to Dim Light in a 5-foot radius.  
Luck Blade  
Weapon (Glaive, Greatsword, Longsword, Rapier,  
Scimitar, Sickle, or Shortsword), Legendary (Requires  
Attunement)  
You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls  
made with this magic weapon. While the weapon is  
on your person, you also gain a +1 bonus to saving  
throws.  
Luck. If the weapon is on your person, you can call  
on its luck (no action required) to reroll one failed  
D20 Test if you don’t have the Incapacitated condition. You must use the second roll. Once used, this  
property can’t be used again until the next dawn.  
Wish. The weapon has 1d3 charges. While holding  
it, you can expend 1 charge and cast Wish from it.  
Once used, this property can’t be used again until  
the next dawn. The weapon loses this property if it  
has no charges.  
Mace of Disruption  
Weapon (Mace), Rare (Requires Attunement)  
When you hit a Fiend or an Undead with this magic  
weapon, that creature takes an extra 2d6 Radiant  
damage. If the target has 25 Hit Points or fewer  
after taking this damage, it must succeed on a DC  
15 Wisdom saving throw or be destroyed. On a successful save, the creature has the Frightened condition until the end of your next turn.  
Light. While you hold this weapon, it sheds Bright  
Light in a 20-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 20 feet.  
Mace of Smiting  
Weapon (Mace), Rare  
You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage  
rolls made with this magic weapon. The bonus increases to +3 when you use the weapon to attack a  
Construct.  
When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with  
this weapon, the target takes an extra 7 Bludgeoning damage, or 14 Bludgeoning damage if it’s a  
Construct. If a Construct has 25 Hit Points or fewer  
after taking this damage, it is destroyed.  
Mace of Terror  
Weapon (Mace), Rare (Requires Attunement)  
This magic weapon has 3 charges and regains 1d3  
expended charges daily at dawn. While holding  
the weapon, you can take a Magic action and expend 1 charge to release a wave of terror from it.  
Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you  
must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or  
have the Frightened condition for 1 minute. While  
Frightened in this way, a creature must spend its  
turns trying to move as far away from you as it can,  
and it can’t make Opportunity Attacks. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape  
from an effect that prevents it from moving. If it  
has nowhere it can move, the creature can take the  
Dodge action. At the end of each of its turns, a creature repeats the save, ending the effect on itself on  
a success.  
Mantle of Spell Resistance  
Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement)  
You have Advantage on saving throws against spells  
while you wear this cloak.  
Manual of Bodily Health  
Wondrous Item, Very Rare  
This book contains health and nutrition tips, and  
its words are charged with magic. If you spend 48  
hours over a period of 6 days or fewer studying the  
book’s contents and practicing its guidelines, your  
Constitution increases by 2, to a maximum of 30.  
The manual then loses its magic but regains it in a  
century.  
Manual of Gainful Exercise  
Wondrous Item, Very Rare  
This book describes fitness exercises, and its words  
are charged with magic. If you spend 48 hours over  
a period of 6 days or fewer studying the book’s contents and practicing its guidelines, your Strength increases by 2, to a maximum of 30. The manual then  
loses its magic but regains it in a century.  
Manual of Golems  
Wondrous Item, Very Rare  
This tome contains information and incantations  
necessary to make a particular type of golem. The  
GM chooses the type or determines it randomly by  
rolling on the accompanying table. To decipher and  
use the manual, you must be a spellcaster with at  
least two level 5 spell slots. A creature that can’t  
use a Manual of Golems and attempts to read it takes  
6d6 Psychic damage.  
To create a golem, you must spend the time shown  
on the table, working without interruption with the  
manual at hand and resting no more than 8 hours  
per day. You must also pay the specified cost to purchase supplies.

on it. See “Monsters” for the golem’s stat block. The  
golem is under your control, and it understands and  
obeys your commands.

Manual of Quickness of Action  
Wondrous Item, Very Rare  
This book contains coordination and balance exercises, and its words are charged with magic.  
If you spend 48 hours over a period of 6 days or  
fewer studying the book’s contents and practicing  
its guidelines, your Dexterity increases by 2, to a  
maximum of 30. The manual then loses its magic  
but regains it in a century.  
Marvelous Pigments  
Wondrous Item, Very Rare  
This fine wooden box contains 1d4 pots of pigment  
and a brush (weighing 1 pound in total).  
Using the brush and expending 1 pot of pigment,  
you can paint any number of three-dimensional  
objects and terrain features (such as walls, doors,  
trees, flowers, weapons, webs, and pits), provided  
these elements are all confined to a 20-foot Cube.  
The effort takes 10 minutes (regardless of the number of elements you create), during which time you  
must remain in the Cube, and requires Concentration. If your Concentration is broken or you leave  
the Cube before the work is done, all the painted  
elements vanish, and the pot of pigment is wasted.  
When the work is done, all the painted objects  
and terrain features become real. Thus, painting a  
door on a wall creates an actual door, which can be  
opened to whatever is beyond. Painting a pit creates  
a real pit, the entire depth of which must lie within  
the 20-foot Cube.  
No object created by a pot of pigment can have a  
value greater than 25 GP, and the total value of all  
objects created by a pot of pigment can’t exceed 500  
GP. If you paint objects of greater value (such as a  
large pile of gold), they look authentic, but close inspection reveals they’re made from paste, cookies,  
or some other worthless material.  
If you paint a form of energy such as fire or lightning, the energy dissipates as soon as you complete  
the painting, doing no harm.  
Medallion of Thoughts  
Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)  
The medallion has 5 charges. While wearing it, you  
can expend 1 charge to cast Detect Thoughts (save  
DC 13) from it. The medallion regains 1d4 expended  
charges daily at dawn.  
Mirror of Life Trapping  
Wondrous Item, Very Rare  
When this 4-foot-tall, 2-foot-wide mirror is viewed  
indirectly, its surface shows faint images of creatures. The mirror weighs 50 pounds, and it has AC  
11, HP 10, Immunity to Poison and Psychic damage,  
and Vulnerability to Bludgeoning damage. It shatters and is destroyed when reduced to 0 Hit Points.  
If the mirror is hanging on a vertical surface and  
you are within 5 feet of it, you can take a Magic  
action and use a command word to activate it. It  
remains activated until you take a Magic action and  
repeat the command word to deactivate it.  
Any creature other than you that sees its reflection in the activated mirror while within 30 feet  
of the mirror must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma  
saving throw or be trapped, along with anything it  
is wearing or carrying, in one of the mirror’s twelve  
extradimensional cells. A creature that knows the  
mirror’s nature makes the save with Advantage,  
and Constructs succeed on the save automatically.  
An extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse  
filled with thick fog that reduces visibility to 10  
feet. Creatures trapped in the mirror’s cells don’t  
age, and they don’t need to eat, drink, or sleep. A  
creature trapped within a cell can escape using  
magic that permits planar travel. Otherwise, the  
creature is confined to the cell until freed.  
If the mirror traps a creature but its twelve extradimensional cells are already occupied, the mirror frees one trapped creature at random to accommodate the new prisoner. A freed creature appears  
in an unoccupied space within sight of the mirror  
but facing away from it. If the mirror is shattered,  
all creatures it contains are freed and appear in unoccupied spaces near it.  
While within 5 feet of the mirror, you can take a  
Magic action to name one creature trapped in it or  
call out a particular cell by number. The creature  
named or contained in the named cell appears as an  
image on the mirror’s surface. You and the creature  
can then communicate.  
In a similar way, you can take a Magic action and  
use a second command word to free one creature  
trapped in the mirror. The freed creature appears,  
along with its possessions, in the unoccupied space  
nearest to the mirror and facing away from it.  
Placing the mirror inside an extradimensional  
space created by a Bag of Holding, Portable Hole,  
or similar item instantly destroys both items and  
opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates  
where the one item was placed inside the other. Any  
creature within 10 feet of the gate and not behind  
Total Cover is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The  
gate is one-way only and can’t be reopened.

Mithral Armor  
Armor (Any Medium or Heavy, Except Hide Armor),  
Uncommon  
Mithral is a light, flexible metal. Armor made of this  
substance can be worn under normal clothes. If the  
armor normally imposes Disadvantage on Dexterity  
(Stealth) checks or has a Strength requirement, the  
mithral version of the armor doesn’t.  
Mysterious Deck  
Wondrous Item, Legendary  
Usually found in a box or pouch, this deck contains  
a number of cards made of ivory or vellum. Most  
(75 percent) of these decks have thirteen cards, but  
some have twenty-two. Use the appropriate column  
of the Mysterious Deck table when randomly determining cards drawn from the deck.  
Before you draw a card, you must declare how  
many cards you intend to draw and then draw them  
randomly. Any cards drawn in excess of this number have no effect. Otherwise, as soon as you draw a  
card from the deck, its magic takes effect. You must  
draw each card no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. If you fail to draw the chosen number,  
the remaining number of cards fly from the deck on  
their own and take effect all at once.  
Once a card is drawn, it disappears. Unless the  
card is the Fool or Jester, the card reappears in the  
deck, making it possible to draw the same card  
twice. (Once the Fool or Jester has left the deck, reroll on the table if that card comes up again.)

Each card’s effect is described below.  
Balance. You can increase one of your ability  
scores by 2, to a maximum of 22, provided you also  
decrease another one of your ability scores by 2.  
You can’t decrease an ability that has a score of 5  
or lower. Alternatively, you can choose not to adjust your ability scores, in which case this card has  
no effect.  
Comet. The next time you enter combat against  
one or more Hostile creatures, you can select one  
of them as your foe when you roll Initiative. If you  
reduce your foe to 0 Hit Points during that combat,  
you have Advantage on Death Saving Throws for 1  
year. If someone else reduces your chosen foe to 0  
Hit Points or you don’t choose a foe, this card has no  
effect.  
Donjon. You disappear and become entombed  
in a state of suspended animation in an extradimensional sphere. Everything you’re wearing and  
carrying disappears with you except for Artifacts,  
which stay behind in the space you occupied when  
you disappeared. You remain imprisoned until you  
are found and removed from the sphere. You can’t  
be located by any Divination magic, but a Wish spell  
can reveal the location of your prison. You draw no  
more cards.  
Euryale. The card’s medusa-like visage curses  
you. You take a -2 penalty to saving throws while  
cursed in this way. Only a god or the magic of the  
Fates card can end this curse.  
Fates. Reality’s fabric unravels and spins anew, allowing you to avoid or erase one event as if it never  
happened. You can use the card’s magic as soon  
as you draw the card or at any other time before  
you die.  
Flames. A powerful devil becomes your enemy.  
The devil seeks your ruin and torments you, savoring your suffering before attempting to slay you.  
This enmity lasts until either you or the devil dies.  
Fool. You have Disadvantage on D20 Tests for the  
next 72 hours. Draw another card; this draw doesn’t  
count as one of your declared draws.  
Gem. Twenty-five pieces of jewelry worth 2,000  
GP each or fifty gems worth 1,000 GP each appear at  
your feet.  
232 System Reference Document 5.2.1  
Jester. You have Advantage on D20 Tests for the  
next 72 hours, or you can draw two additional cards  
beyond your declared draws.  
Key. A Rare or rarer magic weapon with which  
you are proficient appears on your person. The GM  
chooses the weapon.  
Knight. You gain the service of a Knight, who  
magically appears in an unoccupied space you  
choose within 30 feet of yourself. The knight has the  
same alignment as you and serves you loyally until  
death, believing the two of you have been drawn together by fate. Work with your GM to create a name  
and backstory for this NPC. The GM can use a different stat block to represent the knight, as desired.  
Moon. You gain the ability to cast Wish 1d3 times.  
Puzzle. Permanently reduce your Intelligence or  
Wisdom by 1d4 + 1 (to a minimum score of 1). You  
can draw one additional card beyond your declared  
draws.  
Rogue. An NPC of the GM’s choice becomes Hostile  
toward you. You don’t know the identity of this NPC  
until they or someone else reveals it. Nothing less  
than a Wish spell or divine intervention can end the  
NPC’s hostility toward you.  
Ruin. All forms of wealth that you carry or own,  
other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable  
property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land  
you own are lost in a way that alters reality the  
least. Any documentation that proves you should  
own something lost to this card also disappears.  
Sage. At any time you choose within one year of  
drawing this card, you can ask a question in meditation and mentally receive a truthful answer to that  
question.  
Skull. An Avatar of Death (see the accompanying  
stat block) appears in an unoccupied space as close  
to you as possible. The avatar targets only you with  
its attacks, appearing as a ghostly skeleton clad in a  
tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe.  
The avatar disappears when it drops to 0 Hit Points  
or you die. If an ally of yours deals damage to the  
avatar, that ally summons another Avatar of Death.  
The new avatar appears in an unoccupied space as  
close to that ally as possible and targets only that  
ally with its attacks. You and your allies can each  
summon only one avatar as a consequence of this  
draw. A creature slain by an avatar can’t be restored  
to life.  
Star. Increase one of your ability scores by 2, to a  
maximum of 24.  
Sun. A magic item (chosen by the GM) appears on  
your person. In addition, you gain 10 Temporary Hit  
Points daily at dawn until you die.  
Talons. Every magic item you wear or carry  
disintegrates. Artifacts in your possession vanish  
instead.  
Throne. You gain proficiency and Expertise in  
your choice of History, Insight, Intimidation, or Persuasion. In addition, you gain rightful ownership of  
a small keep somewhere in the world. However, the  
keep is currently home to one or more monsters,  
which must be cleared out before you can claim the  
keep as yours.  
Void. Your soul is drawn from your body and  
contained in an object in a place of the GM’s choice.  
One or more powerful beings guard the place. While  
your soul is trapped in this way, your body is inert,  
ceases aging, and requires no food, air, or water. A  
Wish spell can’t return your soul to your body, but  
the spell reveals the location of the object that holds  
your soul. You draw no more cards.

Necklace of Adaptation  
Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)  
While wearing this necklace, you can breathe normally in any environment, and you have Advantage  
on saving throws made to avoid or end the Poisoned  
condition.  
233 System Reference Document 5.2.1  
Necklace of Fireballs  
Wondrous Item, Rare  
This necklace has 1d6 + 3 beads hanging from it.  
You can take a Magic action to detach a bead and  
throw it up to 60 feet away. When it reaches the end  
of its trajectory, the bead detonates as a level 3 Fireball (save DC 15).  
You can hurl multiple beads, or even the whole  
necklace, at one time. When you do so, increase the  
damage of the Fireball by 1d6 for each bead after  
the first (maximum 12d6).  
Necklace of Prayer Beads  
Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement by a  
Cleric, Druid, or Paladin)  
This necklace has 1d4 + 2 magic beads made from  
aquamarine, black pearl, or topaz. It also has many  
nonmagical beads made from stones such as amber,  
bloodstone, citrine, coral, jade, pearl, or quartz. If a  
magic bead is removed from the necklace, that bead  
loses its magic.  
Six types of magic beads exist. The GM decides the  
type of each bead on the necklace or determines it  
randomly by rolling on the table below. A necklace  
can have more than one bead of the same type. To  
use one, you must be wearing the necklace. Each  
bead contains a spell that you can cast from it as a  
Bonus Action (using your spell save DC if a save is  
necessary). Once a magic bead’s spell is cast, that  
bead can’t be used again until the next dawn.

20 Bead of Wind  
Walking  
Wind Walk  
Nine Lives Stealer  
Weapon (Any Simple or Martial), Very Rare (Requires  
Attunement)  
You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls  
made with this magic weapon.  
Life Stealing. The weapon has 1d8 + 1 charges.  
When you attack a creature that has fewer than  
100 Hit Points with this weapon and roll a 20 on the  
d20 for the attack roll, the creature must succeed  
on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be slain  
instantly as the sword tears its life force from its  
body. Constructs and Undead succeed on the save  
automatically. The weapon loses 1 charge if the  
creature is slain. When the weapon has no charges  
remaining, it loses this property.  
Oathbow  
Weapon (Longbow or Shortbow), Very Rare (Requires  
Attunement)  
When you nock an arrow on this bow, it whispers in  
Elvish, “Swift defeat to my enemies.” When you use  
this weapon to make a ranged attack, you can utter  
or sign the following command words: “Swift death  
to you who have wronged me.” The target of your  
attack becomes your sworn enemy until it dies or  
until dawn 7 days later. You can have only one such  
sworn enemy at a time. When your sworn enemy  
dies, you can choose a new one after the next dawn.  
When you make a ranged attack roll with this  
weapon against your sworn enemy, you have Advantage on the roll. In addition, your target gains no  
benefit from Half Cover or Three-Quarters Cover,  
and you suffer no Disadvantage due to long range.  
If the attack hits, your sworn enemy takes an extra  
3d6 Piercing damage.  
While your sworn enemy lives, you have Disadvantage on attack rolls with all other weapons.  
Oil of Etherealness  
Potion, Rare  
One vial of this oil can cover one Medium or smaller  
creature, along with the equipment it’s wearing and  
carrying (one additional vial is required for each  
size category above Medium). Applying the oil takes  
10 minutes. The affected creature then gains the  
effect of the Etherealness spell for 1 hour.  
Beads of this cloudy, gray oil form on the outside  
of its container and quickly evaporate.  
Oil of Sharpness  
Potion, Very Rare  
One vial of this oil can coat one Melee weapon or  
twenty pieces of ammunition, but only ammunition  
and Melee weapons that are nonmagical and deal  
Slashing or Piercing damage are affected. Applying  
the oil takes 1 minute, after which the oil magically  
seeps into whatever it coats, turning the coated  
weapon into a +3 Weapon or the coated ammunition  
into +3 Ammunition.  
This clear, gelatinous oil sparkles with tiny,  
ultrathin silver shards.  
Oil of Slipperiness  
Potion, Uncommon  
One vial of this oil can cover one Medium or smaller  
creature, along with the equipment it’s wearing and  
carrying (one additional vial is required for each  
size category above Medium). Applying the oil takes  
10 minutes. The affected creature then gains the effect of the Freedom of Movement spell for 8 hours.  
Alternatively, the oil can be poured on the ground  
as a Magic action, where it covers a 10-foot square,  
234 System Reference Document 5.2.1  
duplicating the effect of the Grease spell in that area  
for 8 hours.  
This sticky, black unguent is thick and heavy, but  
it flows quickly when poured.  
Pearl of Power  
Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement by  
a Spellcaster)  
While this pearl is on your person, you can take a  
Magic action to regain one expended spell slot of  
level 3 or lower. Once you use the pearl, it can’t be  
used again until the next dawn.  
Periapt of Health  
Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)  
While wearing this pendant, you can take a Magic  
action to regain 2d4 + 2 Hit Points. Once used, this  
property can’t be used again until the next dawn.  
In addition, you have Advantage on saving throws  
to avoid or end the Poisoned condition while you  
wear this pendant.  
Periapt of Proof against Poison  
Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement)  
This delicate silver chain has a brilliant-cut black  
gem pendant. While you wear it, you have Immunity  
to the Poisoned condition and Poison damage.  
Periapt of Wound Closure  
Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)  
While wearing this pendant, you gain the following  
benefits.  
Life Preservation. Whenever you make a Death  
Saving Throw, you can change a roll of 9 or lower to  
a 10, turning a failed save into a successful one.  
Natural Healing Boost. Whenever you roll a Hit  
Point Die to regain Hit Points, double the number of  
Hit Points it restores.  
Philter of Love  
Potion, Uncommon  
The next time you see a creature within 10 minutes  
after drinking this philter, you are charmed by that  
creature and have the Charmed condition for 1  
hour.  
This rose-hued, effervescent liquid contains one  
easy-to-miss bubble shaped like a heart.  
Pipes of Haunting  
Wondrous Item, Uncommon  
These pipes have 3 charges and regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. You can take a Magic  
action to play them and expend 1 charge to create  
an eerie, spellbinding tune. Each creature of your  
choice within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC  
15 Wisdom saving throw or have the Frightened  
condition for 1 minute. A creature that fails the save  
repeats it at the end of each of its turns, ending the  
effect on itself on a success. A creature that succeeds on its save is immune to the effect of these  
pipes for 24 hours.  
Pipes of the Sewers  
Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)  
While these pipes are on your person, ordinary rats  
and giant rats are Indifferent toward you and won’t  
attack you unless you threaten or harm them.  
The pipes have 3 charges and regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you play the pipes  
as a Magic action, you can take a Bonus Action to  
expend 1 to 3 charges, calling forth one Swarm  
of Rats with each expended charge if enough rats  
are within half a mile of you to be called in this  
fashion (as determined by the GM). If there aren’t  
enough rats to form a swarm, the charge is wasted.  
Called swarms move toward the music by the shortest available route but aren’t under your control  
otherwise.  
Whenever a Swarm of Rats that isn’t under another creature’s control comes within 30 feet of you  
while you are playing the pipes, the swarm makes  
a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a successful  
save, the swarm behaves as it normally would and  
can’t be swayed by the pipes’ music for the next 24  
hours. On a failed save, the swarm is swayed by the  
pipes’ music and becomes Friendly to you and your  
allies for as long as you continue to play the pipes  
each round as a Magic action. A Friendly swarm  
obeys your commands. If you issue no commands  
to a Friendly swarm, it defends itself but otherwise  
takes no actions. If a Friendly swarm starts its turn  
more than 30 feet away from you, your control over  
that swarm ends, and the swarm behaves as it normally would and can’t be swayed by the pipes’ music for the next 24 hours.  
Plate Armor of Etherealness  
Armor (Half Plate Armor or Plate Armor), Legendary  
(Requires Attunement)  
While you’re wearing this armor, you can take a  
Magic action and use a command word to gain the  
effect of the Etherealness spell. The spell ends immediately if you remove the armor or take a Magic action to repeat the command word. This property of  
the armor can’t be used again until the next dawn.  
Portable Hole  
Wondrous Item, Rare  
This fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the  
dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular sheet 6 feet in diameter.  
You can take a Magic action to unfold a Portable Hole and place it on or against a solid surface, whereupon the Portable Hole creates an  
235 System Reference Document 5.2.1  
extradimensional hole 10 feet deep. The cylindrical  
space within the hole exists on a different plane  
of existence, so it can’t be used to create open passages. Any creature inside an open Portable Hole  
can exit the hole by climbing out of it.  
You can take a Magic action to close a Portable  
Hole by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and  
folding it up. Folding the cloth closes the hole, and  
any creatures or objects within remain in the extradimensional space. No matter what’s in it, the  
hole weighs next to nothing.  
If the hole is folded up, a creature within the hole’s  
extradimensional space can take an action to make  
a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check. On a successful  
check, the creature forces its way out and appears  
within 5 feet of the Portable Hole. A closed Portable  
Hole holds enough air for 1 hour of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.  
Placing a Portable Hole inside an extradimensional  
space created by a Bag of Holding, Handy Haversack,  
or similar item instantly destroys both items and  
opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates  
where the one item was placed inside the other. Any  
creature within 10 feet of the gate and not behind  
Total Cover is sucked through it and deposited in  
a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate  
then closes. The gate is one-way only and can’t be  
reopened.  
Potion of Animal Friendship  
Potion, Uncommon  
When you drink this potion, you can cast the level  
3 version of the Animal Friendship spell (save DC 13).  
Agitating this potion’s muddy liquid brings little  
bits into view: a fish scale, a hummingbird feather, a  
cat claw, or a squirrel hair.  
Potion of Clairvoyance  
Potion, Rare  
When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of  
the Clairvoyance spell (no Concentration required).  
An eyeball bobs in this potion’s yellowish liquid  
but vanishes when the potion is opened.  
Potion of Climbing  
Potion, Common  
When you drink this potion, you gain a Climb Speed  
equal to your Speed for 1 hour. During this time, you  
have Advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks to  
climb.  
This potion is separated into brown, silver, and  
gray layers resembling bands of stone. Shaking the  
bottle fails to mix the colors.  
Potion of Diminution  
Potion, Rare  
When you drink this potion, you gain the “reduce”  
effect of the Enlarge/Reduce spell for 1d4 hours (no  
Concentration required).  
The red in the potion’s liquid continuously contracts to a tiny bead and then expands to color the  
clear liquid around it. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.  
Potion of Flying  
Potion, Very Rare  
When you drink this potion, you gain a Fly Speed  
equal to your Speed for 1 hour and can hover. If  
you’re in the air when the potion wears off, you fall  
unless you have some other means of staying aloft.  
This potion’s clear liquid floats at the top of its  
container and has cloudy white impurities drifting  
in it.  
Potion of Gaseous Form  
Potion, Rare  
When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of  
the Gaseous Form spell for 1 hour (no Concentration  
required) or until you end the effect as a Bonus  
Action.  
This potion’s container seems to hold fog that  
moves and pours like water.  
Potion of Giant Strength  
Potion, Rarity Varies  
When you drink this potion, your Strength score  
changes for 1 hour. The type of giant determines the  
score (see the table below). The potion has no effect  
on you if your Strength is equal to or greater than  
that score.  
This potion’s transparent liquid has floating in it a  
sliver of light resembling a giant’s fingernail.

Potion, Uncommon  
When you drink this potion, you gain the “enlarge”  
effect of the Enlarge/Reduce spell for 10 minutes (no  
Concentration required).  
The red in the potion’s liquid continuously expands from a tiny bead to color the clear liquid  
around it and then contracts. Shaking the bottle  
fails to interrupt this process.  
236 System Reference Document 5.2.1  
Potions of Healing  
Potion, Rarity Varies  
You regain Hit Points when you drink this potion.  
The number of Hit Points depends on the potion’s  
rarity, as shown in the table below.

This potion’s blue liquid bubbles and steams as if  
boiling.  
Potion of Invisibility  
Potion, Rare  
This potion’s container looks empty but feels as  
though it holds liquid. When you drink the potion,  
you have the Invisible condition for 1 hour. The  
effect ends early if you make an attack roll, deal  
damage, or cast a spell.

cloud of pink floating in it.  
Potion of Poison  
Potion, Uncommon  
This concoction looks, smells, and tastes like a  
Potion of Healing or another beneficial potion. However, it is actually poison masked by illusion magic.  
Identify reveals its true nature.

Potion of Resistance

Potion of Speed  
Potion, Very Rare  
When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of  
the Haste spell for 1 minute (no Concentration required) without suffering the wave of lethargy that  
typically occurs when the effect ends.  
This potion’s yellow fluid is streaked with black  
and swirls on its own.  
Potion of Vitality  
Potion, Very Rare  
When you drink this potion, it removes any  
Exhaustion levels you have and ends the Poisoned  
condition on you. For the next 24 hours, you regain  
the maximum number of Hit Points for any Hit Point  
Die you spend.

dull light, calling to mind a heartbeat.

Quarterstaff of the Acrobat  
Weapon (Quarterstaff), Very Rare (Requires  
Attunement)  
You have a +2 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls  
made with this magic weapon.  
While holding this weapon, you can cause it to  
emit green Dim Light out to 10 feet, either as a Bonus Action or after you roll Initiative, or you can  
extinguish the light as a Bonus Action.  
While holding this weapon, you can take a Bonus  
Action to alter its form, turning it into a 6-inch rod  
(for ease of storage) or a 10-foot pole, or reverting it  
a Quarterstaff; the weapon will elongate only as far  
as the surrounding space allows.  
In certain forms, the weapon has the following additional properties.  
Acrobatic Assist (Quarterstaff and 10-Foot Pole  
Forms Only). While holding this weapon, you have  
Advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks.  
Attack Deflection (Quarterstaff Form Only).  
When you are hit by an attack while holding the  
weapon, you can take a Reaction to twirl the  
weapon around you, gaining a +5 bonus to your Armor Class against the triggering attack, potentially  
causing the attack to miss you. You can’t use this  
property again until you finish a Short or Long Rest.  
Ranged Weapon (Quarterstaff Form Only). This  
weapon has the Thrown property with a normal  
range of 30 feet and a long range of 120 feet. Immediately after you make a ranged attack with the  
weapon, it flies back to your hand.

Ring of Djinni Summoning  
Ring, Legendary (Requires Attunement)  
While wearing this ring, you can take a Magic action  
to summon a particular Djinni from the Elemental  
Plane of Air. The djinni appears in an unoccupied  
space you choose within 120 feet of yourself. It  
remains as long as you maintain Concentration, to a  
maximum of 1 hour, or until it drops to 0 Hit Points.  
While summoned, the djinni is Friendly to you and  
your allies, and it obeys your commands. If you fail  
to command it, the djinni defends itself against attackers but takes no other actions.  
After the djinni departs, it can’t be summoned  
again for 24 hours, and the ring becomes nonmagical if the djinni dies.  
Rings of Djinni Summoning are often created by the  
djinn they summon and given to mortals as gifts of  
friendship or tokens of esteem.  
Ring of Elemental Command  
Ring, Legendary (Requires Attunement)  
Each Ring of Elemental Command is linked to one of

disturbing the matter through which you pass. If  
you end your turn in solid earth or rock, you are  
shunted out to the nearest unoccupied space you  
last occupied.  
Fire. You know Ignan, and you have Immunity to  
Fire damage.  
Water. You know Aquan, you gain a Swim Speed of

spell, which has a save DC of 18.

You can take a Magic action to cause the ring to  
become imperceptible until you take another Magic  
action to make it perceptible, until you remove the  
ring, or until you die.  
If you die while wearing the ring, your soul enters  
it, unless it already houses a soul. You can remain in

239 System Reference Document 5.2.1  
last as long as you maintain Concentration, up to 1  
minute. Each sphere sheds Dim Light in a 30-foot  
radius.  
As a Bonus Action, you can move each sphere up  
to 30 feet, but no farther than 120 feet away from  
yourself. The first time the sphere comes within 5  
feet of a creature other than you that isn’t behind  
Total Cover, the sphere discharges lightning at that  
creature and disappears. That creature makes a  
DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the  
creature takes Lightning damage based on the number of spheres you created, as shown in the following table. On a successful save, the creature takes  
half as much damage.

Ring of Spell Storing  
Ring, Rare (Requires Attunement)  
This ring stores spells cast into it, holding them until the attuned wearer uses them. The ring can store  
up to 5 levels worth of spells at a time. When found,  
it contains 1d6 - 1 levels of stored spells chosen by  
the GM.  
Any creature can cast a spell of level 1 through 5  
into the ring by touching the ring as the spell is cast.  
The spell has no effect other than to be stored in the  
ring. If the ring can’t hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to  
cast the spell determines how much space it uses.  
While wearing this ring, you can cast any spell  
stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save  
DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of  
the original caster but is otherwise treated as if you  
cast the spell. The spell cast from the ring is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.

saving throws against spells. If you succeed on the  
save for a spell of level 7 or lower, the spell has no  
effect on you. If that spell targeted only you and

caster must make a saving throw against the spell  
using their own spell save DC.

a spectral ram’s head and makes its attack roll with  
a +7 bonus. On a hit, for each charge you spend, the  
target takes 2d10 Force damage and is pushed 5  
feet away from you.  
Alternatively, you can expend 1 to 3 of the ring’s  
charges as a Magic action to try to break a nonmagical object you can see within 60 feet of yourself  
that isn’t being worn or carried. The ring makes  
a Strength check with a +5 bonus for each charge

foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or up to 3 feet  
of wood or dirt. Thicker substances or a thin sheet

on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.  
Special Senses. You have Darkvision and Truesight,  
both with a range of 120 feet.  
Drawbacks. A Light spell cast on the robe or a  
Daylight spell cast within 5 feet of the robe gives  
you the Blinded condition for 1 minute. At the end of  
each of your turns, you make a Constitution saving  
throw (DC 11 for Light or DC 15 for Daylight), ending  
the condition on yourself on a success.

feet, and creatures that can see you have Disadvantage on attack rolls against you. Any creature in the

is activated must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or have the Stunned condition until the  
effect ends.

robe, you can take a Magic action to remove one of  
the stars and expend it to cast the level 5 version of  
Magic Missile. Daily at dusk, 1d6 removed stars reappear on the robe.  
While you wear the robe, you can take a Magic action to enter the Astral Plane along with everything  
you are wearing and carrying. You remain there  
until you take a Magic action to return to the plane  
you were on. You reappear in the last space you

Sorcerer, Warlock, or Wizard)

and adorned with runes.

colors covering it. While wearing the robe, you can  
take a Magic action to detach one of the patches,

becomes an ordinary garment.  
The robe has two of each of the following patches:  
• Bullseye Lantern (filled and lit)  
• Dagger  
• Mirror  
• Pole  
• Rope (coiled)  
• Sack  
In addition, the robe has 4d4 other patches. The GM

by rolling on the following table.  
1d100 Patch  
01–08 Bag of 100 GP  
09–15 Silver coffer (1 foot long, 6 inches wide and  
deep) worth 500 GP  
16–22 Iron door (up to 10 feet wide and 10 feet high,  
barred on one side of your choice), which you  
can place in an opening you can reach; it conforms to fit the opening, attaching and hinging  
itself  
23–30 10 gems worth 100 GP each  
31–44 Wooden ladder (24 feet long)  
45–51 Riding Horse with a Riding Saddle  
52–59 Open pit (a 10-foot Cube), which you can

91–96 Window (2 feet by 4 feet, up to 2 feet deep),  
which you can place on a vertical surface you

97–00 Portable Ram  
Rod of Absorption  
Rod, Very Rare (Requires Attunement)  
While holding this rod, you can take a Reaction to  
absorb a spell that is targeting only you and doesn’t  
create an area of effect. The absorbed spell’s effect  
is canceled, and the spell’s energy—not the spell itself—is stored in the rod. The energy has the same  
level as the spell when it was cast. A canceled spell  
dissipates with no effect, and any resources used to  
cast it are wasted. The rod can absorb and store up  
to 50 levels of energy over the course of its existence.  
Once the rod absorbs 50 levels of energy, it can’t absorb more. If you are targeted by a spell that the rod  
can’t store, the rod has no effect on that spell.  
When you become attuned to the rod, you know  
how many levels of energy the rod has absorbed  
over the course of its existence and how many levels  
of spell energy it currently has stored.  
If you are a spellcaster holding the rod, you can  
convert energy stored in it into spell slots to cast  
spells you have prepared or know. You can create  
spell slots only of a level equal to or lower than your  
own spell slots, up to a maximum of level 5. You use  
the stored levels in place of your slots but otherwise  
cast the spell as normal. For example, you can use 3  
levels stored in the rod as a level 3 spell slot.  
A newly found rod typically has 1d10 levels of  
spell energy stored in it. A rod that can no longer  
absorb spell energy and has no energy remaining  
becomes nonmagical.  
Rod of Alertness  
Rod, Very Rare (Requires Attunement)  
This rod has the following properties.  
Alertness. While holding the rod, you have  
Advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and on  
Initiative rolls.  
Spells. While holding the rod, you can cast the following spells from it:  
• Detect Evil and Good  
• Detect Magic  
• Detect Poison and Disease  
• See Invisibility  
Protective Aura. As a Magic action, you can plant  
the haft end of the rod in the ground, whereupon  
the rod’s head sheds Bright Light in a 60-foot radius  
and Dim Light for an additional 60 feet. While in  
that Bright Light, you and your allies gain a +1  
bonus to Armor Class and saving throws and can  
sense the location of any Invisible creature that is  
also in the Bright Light.  
The rod’s head stops glowing and the effect ends  
after 10 minutes or when a creature takes a Magic  
action to pull the rod from the ground. Once used,  
this property can’t be used again until the next  
dawn.  
Rod of Lordly Might  
Rod, Legendary (Requires Attunement)  
This rod has a flanged head, and it functions as a  
magic Mace that grants a +3 bonus to attack rolls  
and damage rolls made with it. The rod has properties associated with six different buttons that are  
set in a row along the haft. It has three other properties as well, detailed below.  
Buttons. You can press one of the following buttons as a Bonus Action; a button’s effect lasts until  
you push a different button or until you push the  
same button again, which causes the rod to revert  
to its normal form:  
Button 1. A fiery blade sprouts from the end opposite the rod’s flanged head. The flames shed  
Bright Light in a 40-foot radius and Dim Light for  
an additional 40 feet, and the blade functions as  
a magic Longsword or Shortsword (your choice)  
that deals an extra 2d6 Fire damage on a hit.  
Button 2. The rod’s flanged head folds down and  
two crescent-shaped blades spring out, transforming the rod into a magic Battleaxe that grants  
a +3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made  
with it.  
Button 3. The rod’s flanged head folds down, a  
spear point springs from the rod’s tip, and the  
rod’s handle lengthens into a 6-foot haft, transforming the rod into a magic Spear that grants a  
+3 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls made  
with it.  
Button 4. The rod transforms into a climbing pole  
up to 50 feet long (you specify the length), though  
the rod’s buttons remain within your reach. In  
surfaces as hard as granite, a spike at the bottom and three hooks at the top anchor the pole.  
Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the  
sides, 1 foot apart, forming a ladder. The pole can  
bear up to 4,000 pounds. More weight or lack of  
solid anchoring causes the rod to revert to its  
normal form.  
Button 5. The rod transforms into a handheld  
battering ram and grants its user a +10 bonus  
to Strength (Athletics) checks made to break  
through doors, barricades, and other barriers.  
Button 6. The rod assumes or remains in its normal form and indicates magnetic north. (Nothing  
happens if this function of the rod is used in a  
242 System Reference Document 5.2.1  
location that has no magnetic north.) The rod also  
gives you knowledge of your approximate depth  
beneath the ground or your height above it.  
Drain Life. When you hit a creature with a melee  
attack using the rod, you can force the target to  
make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed  
save, the target takes an extra 4d6 Necrotic damage, and you regain a number of Hit Points equal to  
half that Necrotic damage. Once used, this property  
can’t be used again until the next dawn.  
Paralyze. When you hit a creature with a melee  
attack using the rod, you can force the target to  
make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed  
save, the target has the Paralyzed condition for 1  
minute. The target repeats the save at the end of  
each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.  
Once used, this property can’t be used again until  
the next dawn.  
Terrify. While holding the rod, you can take a  
Magic action to force each creature you can see  
within 30 feet of yourself to make a DC 17 Wisdom  
saving throw. On a failed save, a target has the  
Frightened condition for 1 minute. A Frightened  
target repeats the save at the end of each of its  
turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once  
used, this property can’t be used again until the  
next dawn.  
Rod of Resurrection  
Rod, Legendary (Requires Attunement)  
The rod has 5 charges. While you hold it, you can  
cast one of the following spells from it: Heal (expends 1 charge) or Resurrection (expends 5 charges).  
The rod regains 1 expended charge daily at dawn.  
If you expend the last charge, roll 1d20. On a 1, the  
rod disappears in a harmless burst of radiance.  
Rod of Rulership  
Rod, Rare (Requires Attunement)  
You can take a Magic action to present the rod and  
command obedience from each creature of your  
choice that you can see within 120 feet of yourself. Each target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom  
saving throw or have the Charmed condition for 8  
hours. While Charmed in this way, the creature regards you as its trusted leader. If harmed by you or  
your allies or commanded to do something contrary  
to its nature, a target ceases to be Charmed in this  
way. Once used, this property can’t be used again  
until the next dawn.  
Rod of Security  
Rod, Very Rare  
While holding this rod, you can take a Magic action  
to activate it. The rod then instantly transports you  
and up to 199 other willing creatures you can see  
to a demiplane. You choose the form the demiplane  
takes. It could be a tranquil garden, a cheery tavern,  
an immense palace, a tropical island, a fantastic carnival, or whatever else you can imagine. Regardless  
of its nature, the demiplane contains enough water  
and food to sustain its visitors, and the demiplane’s  
environment can’t harm its occupants. Everything  
else that can be interacted with there can exist  
only there. For example, a flower picked from a  
garden there disappears if it is taken outside the  
demiplane.  
For each hour spent in the demiplane, a visitor  
regains Hit Points as if it had spent 1 Hit Point Die.  
Also, creatures don’t age while there, although time  
passes normally. Visitors can remain there for up to  
200 days divided by the number of creatures present (round down).  
When the time runs out or you take a Magic action  
to end the effect, all visitors reappear in the location they occupied when you activated the rod or an  
unoccupied space nearest that location. Once used,  
this property can’t be used again until 10 days have  
passed.  
Rope of Climbing  
Wondrous Item, Uncommon  
This 60-foot length of rope can hold up to 3,000  
pounds. While holding one end of the rope, you can  
take a Magic action to command the other end of the  
rope to animate and move toward a destination you  
choose, up to the rope’s length away from you. That  
end moves 10 feet on your turn when you first command it and 10 feet at the start of each of your subsequent turns until reaching its destination or until  
you tell it to stop. You can also tell the rope to fasten  
itself securely to an object or to unfasten itself, to  
knot or unknot itself, or to coil itself for carrying.  
If you tell the rope to knot, large knots appear at  
1-foot intervals along the rope. While knotted, the  
rope shortens to a 50-foot length and grants Advantage on ability checks made to climb using the rope.  
The rope has AC 20, HP 20, and Immunity to Poison and Psychic damage. It regains 1 Hit Point every  
5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 Hit Point. If the  
rope drops to 0 Hit Points, it is destroyed.  
Rope of Entanglement  
Wondrous Item, Rare  
This rope is 30 feet long. While holding one end of  
the rope, you can take a Magic action to command  
the other end to dart forward and entangle one  
creature you can see within 20 feet of yourself. The  
target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving  
throw or have the Restrained condition. You can release the target by letting go of your end of the rope  
(causing the rope to coil up in the target’s space)  
or by using a Bonus Action to repeat the command  
(causing the rope to coil up in your hand).

A target Restrained by the rope can take an action  
to make its choice of a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) or  
Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. On a successful check,  
the target is no longer Restrained by the rope. If  
you’re still holding onto the rope when a target escapes from it, you can take a Reaction to command  
the rope to coil up in your hand; otherwise, the rope  
coils up in the target’s space.  
The rope has AC 20, HP 20, and Immunity to Poison and Psychic damage. It regains 1 Hit Point every  
5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 Hit Point. If the  
rope drops to 0 Hit Points, it is destroyed.  
Scarab of Protection  
Wondrous Item, Legendary (Requires Attunement)  
This beetle-shaped medallion provides three benefits while it is on your person.  
Defense. You gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class.  
Preservation. The scarab has 12 charges. If you  
fail a saving throw against a Necromancy spell or  
a harmful effect originating from an Undead, you  
can take a Reaction to expend 1 charge and turn the  
failed save into a successful one. The scarab crumbles into powder and is destroyed when its last  
charge is expended.  
Spell Resistance. You have Advantage on saving  
throws against spells.  
Scimitar of Speed  
Weapon (Scimitar), Very Rare (Requires Attunement)  
You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls  
made with this magic weapon. In addition, you can  
make one attack with it as a Bonus Action on each of  
your turns.  
Sending Stones  
Wondrous Item, Uncommon  
Sending Stones come in pairs, with each stone  
carved to match the other so the pairing is easily  
recognized. While you touch one stone, you can cast  
Sending from it. The target is the bearer of the other  
stone. If no creature bears the other stone, you  
know that fact as soon as you use the stone, and you  
don’t cast the spell.  
Once Sending is cast using either stone, the stones  
can’t be used again until the next dawn. If one of the  
stones in a pair is destroyed, the other one becomes  
nonmagical.  
Sentinel Shield  
Armor (Shield), Uncommon  
While holding this Shield, you have Advantage on  
Initiative rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks.  
The Shield is emblazoned with a symbol of an eye.  
Shield, +1, +2, or +3  
Armor (Shield), Uncommon (+1), Rare (+2), or Very  
Rare (+3)  
While holding this Shield, you have a bonus to Armor Class determined by the Shield’s rarity, in addition to the Shield’s normal bonus to AC.  
Shield of Missile Attraction  
Armor (Shield), Rare (Requires Attunement)  
While holding this Shield, you have Resistance to  
damage from attacks made with Ranged weapons.  
Curse. This Shield is cursed. Attuning to it curses  
you until you are targeted by a Remove Curse spell  
or similar magic. Removing the Shield fails to  
end the curse on you. Whenever an attack with a  
Ranged weapon targets a creature within 10 feet  
of you, the curse causes you to become the target  
instead.  
Shield of the Cavalier  
Armor (Shield), Very Rare (Requires Attunement)  
While holding this Shield, you have a +2 bonus to  
Armor Class. This bonus is in addition to the Shield’s  
normal bonus to AC.  
The Shield has the following additional properties  
that you can use while holding it.  
Forceful Bash. When you take the Attack action,  
you can make one of the attack rolls using the Shield  
against a target within 5 feet of yourself. Apply your  
Proficiency Bonus and Strength modifier to the attack roll. On a hit, the Shield deals Force damage to  
the target equal to 2d6 + 2 plus your Strength modifier, and if the target is a creature, you can push  
it up to 10 feet directly away from yourself. If the  
creature is your size or smaller, you can also knock  
it down, giving it the Prone condition.  
Protective Field. As a Reaction, when you or an  
ally you can see within 5 feet of you is targeted by  
an attack or makes a saving throw against an area  
of effect, you can use the Shield to create an immobile 5-foot Emanation originating from you. When  
the Emanation appears, any creatures or objects not  
fully contained within it are pushed into the nearest  
unoccupied spaces outside it. The attack or area of  
effect that triggered the Reaction has no effect on  
creatures and objects inside the Emanation, which  
lasts as long as you maintain Concentration, up to 1  
minute. Nothing can pass into or out of the Emanation. A creature or object inside the Emanation can’t  
be damaged by attacks or effects originating from  
outside, nor can a creature inside the Emanation  
damage anything outside it. Once this property is  
used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.

Slippers of Spider Climbing  
Wondrous Item, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)  
While you wear these light shoes, you can move  
up, down, and across vertical surfaces and along  
ceilings, while leaving your hands free. You have a  
Climb Speed equal to your Speed. However, the slippers don’t allow you to move this way on a slippery  
surface, such as one covered by ice or oil.  
Sovereign Glue  
Wondrous Item, Legendary  
This viscous, milky-white substance can form a permanent adhesive bond between any two objects. It  
must be stored in a jar or flask that has been coated  
inside with Oil of Slipperiness. When found, a container contains 1d6 + 1 ounces.  
One ounce of the glue can cover a 1-foot square  
surface. Applying an ounce of Sovereign Glue takes  
a Utilize action, and the applied glue takes 1 minute  
to set. Once it has done so, the bond it creates can be  
broken only by the application of Universal Solvent  
or Oil of Etherealness, or with a Wish spell.  
Spellguard Shield  
Armor (Shield), Very Rare (Requires Attunement)  
While holding this Shield, you have Advantage on  
saving throws against spells and other magical  
effects, and spell attack rolls have Disadvantage  
against you.  
Spell Scroll  
Scroll, Rarity Varies  
A Spell Scroll bears the words of a single spell, written in a mystical cipher. If the spell is on your spell  
list, you can read the scroll and cast its spell without Material components. Otherwise, the scroll is  
unintelligible. Casting the spell by reading the scroll  
requires the spell’s normal casting time. Once the  
spell is cast, the scroll crumbles to dust. If the casting is interrupted, the scroll isn’t lost.  
If the spell is on your spell list but of a higher level  
than you can normally cast, you make an ability  
check using your spellcasting ability to determine  
whether you cast the spell. The DC equals 10 plus  
the spell’s level. On a failed check, the spell disappears from the scroll with no other effect.  
The level of the spell on the scroll determines the  
spell’s saving throw DC and attack bonus, as well as  
the scroll’s rarity, as shown in the following table.  

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Spell Level Rarity|Save DC|Attack Bonus  <br>+5  <br>+5|
|Cantrip  <br>1|Common  <br>Common|13  <br>13|

8 Very Rare 18 +10  
9 Legendary 19 +11  
Copying a Scroll into a Spellbook. A Wizard spell  
on a Spell Scroll can be copied into a spellbook.  
When a spell is copied in this way, the copier must  
succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a  
DC equal to 10 plus the spell’s level. On a successful  
check, the spell is copied. Whether the check succeeds or fails, the Spell Scroll is destroyed.  
Sphere of Annihilation  
Wondrous Item, Legendary  
This 2-foot-diameter black sphere is a hole in the  
multiverse, hovering in space and stabilized by a  
magical field surrounding it.  
The sphere obliterates all matter it passes  
through and all matter that passes through it. Artifacts are the exception. Unless an Artifact is susceptible to damage from a Sphere of Annihilation, it  
passes through the sphere unscathed. Anything else  
that touches the sphere but isn’t wholly engulfed  
and obliterated by it takes 8d10 Force damage.  
Controlling the Sphere. A Sphere of Annihilation is  
stationary until someone takes control of it. If you  
are within 60 feet of a sphere, you can take a Magic  
action to make a DC 25 Intelligence (Arcana) check.  
On a successful check, you control the sphere until  
the start of your next turn, and if it was under another creature’s control, that creature loses control  
of the sphere. On a failed check, the sphere moves  
10 feet toward you in a straight line.  
While in control of the sphere, you can take a  
Bonus Action to cause it to move in one direction  
of your choice, up to a number of feet equal to  
5 times your Intelligence modifier (minimum 5  
feet). Any creature whose space the sphere enters  
must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw  
or be touched by it, taking 8d10 Force damage. A  
creature reduced to 0 Hit Points by this damage is  
obliterated, leaving its possessions behind but no  
other physical remains.  
Sphere Interactions. If the sphere comes into  
contact with a planar portal (such as that created by  
the Gate spell) or an extradimensional space (such  
as that within a Portable Hole), the GM determines  
randomly what happens using the following table.  
245 System Reference Document 5.2.1  
1d100 Result  
01–50 The sphere is destroyed.  
51–85 The sphere moves through the portal or into  
the extradimensional space.  
86–00 A spatial rift sends the sphere and each creature and object within 180 feet of the sphere  
to a random plane of existence.

you can use any of its properties:

its caster as if you had cast the spell.

Retributive Strike. You can take a Magic action to  
break the staff over your knee or against a solid surface. The staff is destroyed and releases its magic in  
an explosion that fills a 30-foot Emanation originating from itself. You have a 50 percent chance to instantly travel to a random plane of existence, avoiding the explosion. If you fail to avoid the effect, you  
take Force damage equal to 16 times the number  
of charges in the staff. Each other creature in the

take a Magic action and expend 1 charge to cause  
a swarm of harmless flying insects to fill a 30-  
foot Emanation originating from you. The insects

Obscured for creatures other than you. A strong  
wind (like that created by Gust of Wind) disperses  
the swarm and ends the effect.

Staff of the Python  
Staff, Uncommon (Requires Attunement)  
As a Magic action, you can throw this staff so that it  
lands in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you,  
causing the staff to become a Giant Constrictor  
Snake in that space. The snake is under your control and shares your Initiative count, taking its turn  
immediately after yours.  
On your turn, you can mentally command the  
snake (no action required) if it is within 60 feet of  
you and you don’t have the Incapacitated condition.  
You decide what action the snake takes and where it  
moves during its turn, or you can issue it a general  
command, such as to attack your enemies or guard  
a location. Absent commands from you, the snake  
defends itself.  
As a Bonus Action, you can command the snake  
to revert to staff form in its current space, and you  
can’t use the staff’s property again for 1 hour. If the  
snake is reduced to 0 Hit Points, it dies and reverts  
to its staff form; the staff then shatters and is destroyed. If the snake reverts to staff form before  
losing all its Hit Points, it regains all of them.  
Staff of the Woodlands

This staff has 6 charges and can be wielded as a

Tree Form. You can take a Magic action to plant  
one end of the staff in earth in an unoccupied space  
and expend 1 charge to transform the staff into  
a healthy tree. The tree is 60 feet tall and has a  
5-foot-diameter trunk, and its branches at the top  
spread out in a 20-foot radius. The tree appears  
ordinary but radiates a faint aura of Transmutation  
magic that can be discerned with the Detect Magic  
spell. While touching the tree and using a Magic  
action, you return the staff to its normal form. Any  
creature in the tree falls when the tree reverts to  
a staff.  
Regaining Charges. The staff regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last  
charge, roll 1d20. On a 1, the staff loses its properties and becomes a nonmagical Quarterstaff.

the staff, you can cause the staff to emit a crack of  
thunder audible out to 300 feet (no action required).  
The target you hit must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or have the Stunned condition  
until the end of your next turn.  
248 System Reference Document 5.2.1  
Thunder and Lightning. Immediately after you  
hit with a melee attack using the staff, you can take  
a Bonus Action to use the Lightning and Thunder  
properties (see above) at the same time. Doing so  
doesn’t expend the daily use of those properties,  
only the use of this one.  
Lightning Strike. You can take a Magic action to  
cause a bolt of lightning to leap from the staff’s tip  
in a Line that is 5 feet wide and 120 feet long. Each  
creature in that Line makes a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 9d6 Lightning damage on a failed  
save or half as much damage on a successful one.  
Thunderclap. You can take a Magic action to  
cause the staff to produce a thunderclap audible out  
to 600 feet. Every creature within a 60-foot Emanation originating from you makes a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes

Necrotic damage to the target and force it to make  
a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed  
save, the target has Disadvantage for 1 hour on any  
ability check or saving throw that uses Strength or  
Constitution.  
Stone of Controlling Earth Elementals  
Wondrous Item, Rare  
While touching this 5-pound stone to the ground,  
you can take a Magic action to summon an Earth  
Elemental. The elemental appears in an unoccupied  
space you choose within 30 feet of yourself, obeys  
your commands, and takes its turn immediately  
after you on your Initiative count. The elemental  
disappears after 1 hour, when it dies, or when you  
dismiss it as a Bonus Action. The stone can’t be used  
this way again until the next dawn.

can take a Bonus Action to cause a blade of pure  
radiance to spring into existence or make the

Shortswords, you are proficient with the Sun Blade.  
You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls and damage  
rolls made with this weapon, which deals Radiant  
damage instead of Slashing damage. When you hit  
an Undead with it, that target takes an extra 1d8  
Radiant damage.  
Sunlight. The sword’s luminous blade emits  
Bright Light in a 15-foot radius and Dim Light for  
an additional 15 feet. The light is sunlight. While  
the blade persists, you can take a Magic action to  
expand or reduce its radius of Bright Light and Dim  
Light by 5 feet each, to a maximum of 30 feet each  
or a minimum of 10 feet each.  
Sword of Life Stealing  
Weapon (Glaive, Greatsword, Longsword, Rapier,  
Scimitar, or Shortsword), Rare (Requires Attunement)  
When you attack a creature with this magic weapon  
and roll a 20 on the d20 for the attack roll, that

Necrotic damage and must succeed on a DC 15  
Constitution saving throw or be unable to regain Hit  
Points for 1 hour. The target repeats the save at the  
end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on  
a success.  
Talisman of Pure Good  
Wondrous Item, Legendary (Requires Attunement by a  
Cleric or Paladin)  
This talisman is a mighty symbol of goodness. A  
Fiend or an Undead that touches the talisman takes  
8d6 Radiant damage and takes the damage again  
each time it ends its turn holding or carrying the  
talisman.  
249 System Reference Document 5.2.1  
Holy Symbol. You can use the talisman as a Holy  
Symbol. You gain a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls  
while you wear or hold it.  
Pure Rebuke. The talisman has 7 charges. While  
wearing or holding the talisman, you can take a  
Magic action to expend 1 charge and target one  
creature you can see on the ground within 120 feet  
of yourself. A flaming fissure opens under the target, and the target makes a DC 20 Dexterity saving  
throw. If the target is a Fiend or an Undead, it has  
Disadvantage on the save. On a failed save, the target falls into the fissure and is destroyed, leaving no  
remains. On a successful save, the target isn’t cast  
into the fissure but takes 4d6 Psychic damage from  
the ordeal. In either case, the fissure then closes,  
leaving no trace of its existence. When you expend  
the last charge, the talisman disperses into motes of  
golden light and is destroyed.  
Talisman of the Sphere  
Wondrous Item, Legendary (Requires Attunement)

carrying the talisman.  
Holy Symbol. You can use the talisman as a Holy  
Symbol. You gain a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls

feet of yourself. A flaming fissure opens under the  
target, and the target makes a DC 20 Dexterity  
saving throw. If the target is a Celestial, it has Disadvantage on the save. On a failed save, the target  
falls into the fissure and is destroyed, leaving no remains. On a successful save, the target isn’t cast into  
the fissure but takes 4d6 Psychic damage from the

last charge, the talisman dissolves into foul-smelling slime and is destroyed.  
Thunderous Greatclub  
Weapon (Greatclub), Very Rare (Requires Attunement)  
While you are attuned to this magic weapon, your  
Strength is 20 unless your Strength is already equal  
to or greater than that score. The weapon deals an  
extra 1d8 Thunder damage to any creature it hits  
and an extra 3d8 Thunder damage to objects it hits  
that aren’t being worn or carried.  
The weapon has the following additional  
properties.  
Clap of Thunder. As a Magic action, you can strike  
the weapon against a hard surface to create a loud  
clap of thunder audible out to 300 feet. You also create a 30-foot Cone of thunderous energy. Each creature in the Cone must succeed on a DC 15 Strength  
saving throw or have the Prone condition. Nonmagical objects in the Cone that aren’t being worn or  
carried take 3d8 Thunder damage.  
Earthquake. As a Magic action, you can strike  
the weapon against the ground to create an intense  
seismic disturbance in a 50-foot-radius circle centered on the point of impact. Structures in contact  
with the ground in that area take 50 Bludgeoning  
damage, and each creature on the ground in that  
area must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving  
throw or have the Prone condition. If that creature  
is also concentrating, it must succeed on a DC 20  
Constitution saving throw, or its Concentration is  
broken. In addition, you can cause a 30-foot-deep,  
10-foot-wide fissure to open up on the ground anywhere in the area. Any creature on a spot where the  
fissure opens must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving  
throw, falling into the fissure on a failed save or  
moving with the fissure’s edge on a successful one.  
Any structure on a spot where the fissure opens collapses into the fissure. Once you use this property, it  
can’t be used again until the next dawn.

Legendary (Requires Attunement)

rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, the  
weapon ignores Resistance to Slashing damage.  
When you use this weapon to attack a creature  
that has at least one head and roll a 20 on the d20  
for the attack roll, you cut off one of the creature’s  
heads. The creature dies if it can’t survive without  
the lost head. A creature is immune to this effect  
if it has Immunity to Slashing damage, if it doesn’t  
have or need a head, or if the GM decides that the  
creature is too big for its head to be cut off with this  
weapon. Such a creature instead takes an extra 30  
Slashing damage from the hit. If the creature has  
Legendary Resistance, it can expend one daily use  
of that trait to avoid losing its head, taking the extra  
damage instead.

point. Roll 1d10 to determine the spell: on a  
1–2, Darkness; on a 3–4, Faerie Fire; on a 5–6,  
Fireball; on a 7–8, Slow; on a 9–10, Stinking  
Cloud.  
21–25 Nothing happens at the chosen point of origin.  
Instead, you have the Stunned condition until  
the start of your next turn, believing something awesome just happened.  
26–30 You cast Gust of Wind. The Line created by the  
spell extends from you to the chosen point of  
origin.  
31–35 Nothing happens at the chosen point of origin.  
Instead, you take 1d6 Psychic damage.  
36–40 Heavy rain falls for 1 minute in a 120-foothigh, 60-foot-radius Cylinder centered on the  
chosen point of origin. During that time, the  
area of effect is Lightly Obscured.  
41–45 A cloud of 600 oversized butterflies fills a  
60-foot-high, 30-foot-radius Cylinder centered  
on the chosen point of origin. The butterflies  
remain for 10 minutes, during which time the  
area of effect is Heavily Obscured.  
46–50 You cast Lightning Bolt. The Line created by the  
spell extends from you to the chosen point of  
origin.  
51–55 The creature closest to the chosen point of  
origin is enlarged as if you had cast Enlarge/  
Reduce on it. If the target isn’t you and can’t be  
affected by that spell, you become the target  
instead.  
56–60 A magically formed creature appears in an  
unoccupied space as close to the chosen point  
of origin as possible. The creature isn’t under  
your control, acts as it normally would, and  
disappears after 1 hour or when it drops to 0  
Hit Points. Roll 1d4 to determine which creature appears. On a 1, a Rhinoceros appears;  
on a 2, an Elephant appears; and on a 3–4, a  
Rat appears.  
61–64 Grass covers a 60-foot-radius circle of ground,  
with the center of that circle as close to the  
chosen point of origin as possible. Grass that’s  
already there grows to ten times its normal  
size and remains overgrown for 1 minute.  
1d100 Effect  
65–68 An object of the GM’s choice disappears into  
the Ethereal Plane. The object must be neither  
worn nor carried, within 120 feet of the chosen point of origin, and no larger than 10 feet  
in any dimension. If there are no such objects  
in range, nothing happens.  
69–72 Nothing happens at the chosen point of origin.  
Instead, you shrink as if you had cast Enlarge/  
Reduce on yourself and remain in that state for  
1 minute.  
73–77 Leaves grow from the creature nearest to the  
chosen point of origin. Unless they are picked  
off, the leaves turn brown and fall off after 24  
hours.  
78–82 Nothing happens at the chosen point of origin.  
Instead, a burst of colorful, shimmering light  
extends from you in a 30-foot Emanation.  
Each creature in the area must succeed on a  
DC 15 Constitution saving throw or have the  
Blinded condition for 1 minute. A creature repeats the save at the end of each of its turns,  
ending the effect on itself on a success.  
83–87 Nothing happens at the chosen point of origin.  
Instead, you cast Invisibility on yourself.  
88–92 Nothing happens at the chosen point of origin. Instead, a stream of 1d4 × 10 gems, each  
worth 1 GP, shoots from the wand’s tip in a  
Line 30 feet long and 5 feet wide toward the  
chosen point of origin. Each gem deals 1 Bludgeoning damage, and the total damage of the  
gems is divided equally among all creatures in  
the Line.  
93–97 You cast Polymorph, targeting the creature  
closest to the chosen point of origin. Roll 1d4  
to determine the target’s new form. On a 1,  
the new form is a Black Bear; on a 2, the  
new form is a Giant Wasp; on a 3–4, the new  
form is a Frog.  
98–00 The creature closest to the chosen point of  
origin makes a DC 15 Constitution saving  
throw. On a failed save, the creature has the  
Restrained condition and begins to turn to  
stone. While Restrained in this way, the creature repeats the save at the end of its next  
turn. On a successful save, the effect ends.  
On a failed save, the creature has the Petrified  
condition instead of the Restrained condition.  
The petrification lasts until the creature is  
freed by the Greater Restoration spell or similar  
magic.

You can take a Magic action to unfold the Well of  
Many Worlds and place it on a solid surface, whereupon it forms a two-way, 6-foot-diameter, circular  
portal to another world or plane of existence. Each  
time the item opens a portal, the GM decides where  
it leads. The portal remains open until a creature  
within 5 feet of it takes a Magic action to close it  
by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding

it can’t do so again for 1d8 hours.

disappear, you fall. When the wings disappear, you  
can’t use them again for 1d12 hours.

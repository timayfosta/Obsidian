#### Gnome Traits
**Creature Type:** Humanoid
**Size:** Small (about 3 - 4 feet tall)
**Speed:** 30 feet

As a Gnome, you have these special traits.

***Darkvision.*** You have [[Darkvision]] with a range of 60 feet.

***Gnomish Cunning.*** You have [[Advantage]] on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws.

***Gnomish Lineage.*** You are part of a lineage that grants you supernatural abilities. Choose one of the following options; whichever one you choose, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for the spells you cast with this trait (choose the ability when you select the lineage):

   **Forest Gnome.** You know the *[[Minor Illusion]]* cantrip. You also always have the *[[Speak with Animals]]* spell prepared. You can cast it without a spell slot a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [[Long Rest]]. You can also use any spell slots you have to cast the spell.

   **Rock Gnome.** You know the *[[Mending]]* and *[[Prestidigitation]]* cantrips. In addition, you can spend 10 minutes casting *Prestidigitation* to create a Tiny clockwork device (AC 5, 1 HP), such as a toy, fire starter, or music box. When you create the device, you determine its function by choosing one effect from Prestidigitation; the device produces that effect whenever you or another creature takes a Bonus Action to activate it with a touch. If the chosen effect has options within it, you choose one of those options for the device when you create it. For example, if you choose the spell’s ignite-extinguish effect, you determine whether the device ignites or extinguishes fire; the device doesn’t do both. You can have three such devices in existence at a time, and each falls apart 8 hours after its creation or when you dismantle it with a touch as a [[Utilize]] action.

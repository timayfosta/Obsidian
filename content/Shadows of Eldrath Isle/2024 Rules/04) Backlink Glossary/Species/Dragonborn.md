As a Dragonborn, you have these special traits.

***Draconic Ancestry.*** Your lineage stems from a dragon progenitor. Choose the kind of dragon from the Draconic Ancestors table. Your choice affects your Breath Weapon and Damage Resistance traits as well as your appearance.

###### Draconic Ancestors
| Dragon | Damage Type | Dragon | Damage Type |
| ------ | ----------- | ------ | ----------- |
| Gold   | Fire        | Red    | Fire        |
| Silver | Cold        | Blue   | Lightning   |
| Bronze | Lightning   | Green  | Poison      |
| Copper | Acid        | Black  | Acid        |
| Brass  | Fire        | White  | Cold        |

***Breath Weapon.*** When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with an exhalation of magical energy in either a 15-foot [[Cone]] or a 30-foot [[Line]] that is 5 feet wide (choose the shape each time). Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 8 plus your Constitution modifier and Proficiency Bonus). On a failed save, a creature takes 1d10 damage of the type determined by your Draconic Ancestry trait. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage. This damage increases by 1d10 when you reach character levels 5 (2d10), 11 (3d10), and 17 (4d10). You can use this Breath Weapon a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [[Long Rest]].

***Damage Resistance.*** You have [[Resistance]] to the damage type determined by your Draconic Ancestry trait.

***Darkvision.*** You have Darkvision with a range of 60 feet.

***Draconic Flight.*** When you reach character level 5, you can channel draconic magic to give yourself temporary flight. As a Bonus Action, you sprout spectral wings on your back that last for 10 minutes or until you retract the wings (no action required) or have the [[Incapacitated]] condition. During that time, you have a [[Flying|Fly Speed]]equal to your [[Speed]]. Your wings appear to be made of the same energy as your Breath Weapon. Once you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest.

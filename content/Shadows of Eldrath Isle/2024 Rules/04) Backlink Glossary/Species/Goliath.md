#### Goliath Traits
**Creature Type:** Humanoid
**Size:** Medium (about 7 - 8 feet tall)
**Speed:** 35 feet

As a Goliath, you have these special traits.

***Giant Ancestry.*** You are descended from Giants. Choose one of the following benefits - a supernatural boon from your ancestry; you can use the chosen benefit a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [[Long Rest]]:

   **Cloud’s Jaunt (Cloud Giant).** As a Bonus Action, you magically teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see.

   **Fire’s Burn (Fire Giant).** When you hit a target with an attack roll and deal damage to it, you can also deal 1d10 Fire damage to that target.

   **Frost’s Chill (Frost Giant).** When you hit a target with an attack roll and deal damage to it, you can also deal 1d6 Cold damage to that target and reduce its [[Speed]] by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.

   **Hill’s Tumble (Hill Giant).** When you hit a Large or smaller creature with an attack roll and deal damage to it, you can give that target the [[Prone]] condition.

   **Stone’s Endurance (Stone Giant).** When you take damage, you can take a Reaction to roll 1d12. Add your Constitution modifier to the number rolled and reduce the damage by that total.

   **Storm’s Thunder (Storm Giant).** When you take damage from a creature within 60 feet of you, you can take a Reaction to deal 1d8 Thunder damage to that creature.

***Large Form.*** Starting at character level 5, you can change your size to Large as a Bonus Action if you’re in a big enough space. This transformation lasts for 10 minutes or until you end it (no action required). For that duration, you have [[Advantage]] on Strength checks, and your [[Speed]] increases by 10 feet. Once you use this trait, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest.

***Powerful Build.*** You have Advantage on any ability check you make to end the [[Grappled]] condition. You also count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity.

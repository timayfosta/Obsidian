Alchemists, potion brewers, and areas of wild magic are credited with creating the first magical contagions. An outbreak of such a contagion can form the basis of an adventure as characters search for a cure and try to stop the contagion’s spread.
#### Rest and Recuperation
If a creature infected with a magical contagion spends 3 days recuperating - engaging in no activities that would interrupt a [[Long Rest]] - the creature makes a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of the recuperation period. On a successful save, the creature has Advantage on saving throws to fight off the magical contagion for the next 24 hours.
#### Example Contagions
The following examples show how magical contagions can work. Feel free to alter the saving throw DCs, effects, and other characteristics of these contagions to suit your campaign.
- [[Cackle Fever]]
- [[Sewer Plague]]
- [[Sight Rot]]

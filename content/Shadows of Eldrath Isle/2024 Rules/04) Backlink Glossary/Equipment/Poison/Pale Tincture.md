#### Pale Tincture [[Pale Tincture|(250 GP)]]
*Ingested Poison*

A creature subjected to Pale Tincture must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take 3 (1d6) Poison damage and have the [[Poisoned]] condition. The Poisoned creature repeats the save every 24 hours, taking 3 (1d6) Poison damage on a failed save. The damage the poison deals can’t be healed by any means while the creature remains Poisoned. After seven successful saves against the poison, the creature is no longer Poisoned.

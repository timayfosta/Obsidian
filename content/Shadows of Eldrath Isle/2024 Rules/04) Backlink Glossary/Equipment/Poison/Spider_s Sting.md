#### Spider’s Sting [[Spider's Sting|(200 GP)]]
*Injury Poison*

A creature subjected to Spider’s Sting must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or have the [[Poisoned]] condition for 1 hour. If the creature fails the save by 5 or more, the creature also has the [[Unconscious]] condition while Poisoned in this way. The creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake.

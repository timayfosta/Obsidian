While you have the Grappled condition, you experience the following effects.

***Speed 0.*** Your [[Speed]] is 0 and can't increase.

***Attacks Affected.*** You have [[Disadvantage]] on attack rolls against any target other than the grappler.

***Movable.*** The grappler can drag or carry you when it moves, but every foot of movement costs it 1 extra foot unless you are Tiny or two or more sizes smaller than it.

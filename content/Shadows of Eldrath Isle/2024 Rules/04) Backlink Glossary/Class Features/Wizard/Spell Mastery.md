#### Spell Mastery
You have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a level 1 and a level 2 spell in your spellbook that have a casting time of an action. You always have those spells prepared, and you can cast them at their lowest level without expending a spell slot. To cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot. Whenever you finish a [[Long Rest]], you can study your spellbook and replace one of those spells with an eligible spell of the same level from the book.

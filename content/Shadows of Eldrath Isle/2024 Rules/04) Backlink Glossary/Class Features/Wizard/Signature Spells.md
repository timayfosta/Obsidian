#### Signature Spells
Choose two level 3 spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, and you can cast each of them once at level 3 without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can’t cast them in this way again until you finish a [[Short Rest|Short]] or [[Long Rest]]. To cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot.

A condition is a temporary game state. The definition of a condition says how it affects its recipient, and various rules define how to end a condition. This glossary defines these conditions:

- [[Blinded]]
- [[Charmed]]
- [[Deafened]]
- [[Exhaustion]]
- [[Frightened]]
- [[Grappled]]
- [[Incapacitated]]
- [[Invisible]]
- [[Paralyzed]]
- [[Petrified]]
- [[Poisoned]]
- [[Prone]]
- [[Restrained]]
- [[Stunned]]
- [[Unconscious]]

A condition doesn't stack with itself; a recipient either has a condition or doesn't. The Exhaustion condition is an exception to that rule.

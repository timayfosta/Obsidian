A Fly Speed can be used to travel through the air. While you have a Fly Speed, you can stay aloft until you land, fall, or die.

A variety of effects allow a creature to fly. While flying, you fall if you have the [[Incapacitated]] or [[Prone]] condition or your Fly Speed is reduced to 0. You can stay aloft in those circumstances if you can [[Hover]].

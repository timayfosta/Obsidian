A Range weapon has a range in parentheses after the [[Ammunition]] or [[Thrown]] property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon’s normal range in feet, and the second is the weapon’s long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have [[Disadvantage]] on the attack roll. You can’t attack a target beyond the long range.

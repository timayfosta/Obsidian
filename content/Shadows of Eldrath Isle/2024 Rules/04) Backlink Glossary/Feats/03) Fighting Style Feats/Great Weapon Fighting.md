#### Great Weapon Fighting
*Fighting Style Feat (Prerequisite: Fighting Style Feature)*

When you roll damage for an attack you make with a Melee weapon that you are holding with two hands, you can treat any 1 or 2 on a damage die as a 3. The weapon must have the [[Two-Handed]] or [[Versatile]] property to gain this benefit.

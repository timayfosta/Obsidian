### Parts of a Feat
The description of a feat contains the following parts, which are presented after the feat’s name.

***Category.*** A feat is a member of a category, which is noted in the feat. If you’re instructed to choose a feat from a specific category, such as the Origin category, that category must appear under the feat’s name. If you’re instructed to choose a feat and no category is specified, you can choose from any category.

***Prerequisite.*** To take a feat, you must meet any prerequisite in its description unless a feature allows you to take the feat without the prerequisite. If a prerequisite includes a class, you must have at least 1 level in that class to take the feat.

***Benefit.*** The benefits of a feat are detailed after any prerequisites are listed. If you have a feat, you gain its benefits.

***Repeatable.*** A feat can be taken only once unless its description states otherwise in a “Repeatable” subsection.

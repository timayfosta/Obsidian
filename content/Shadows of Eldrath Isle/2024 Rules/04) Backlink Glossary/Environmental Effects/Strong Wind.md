Strong wind imposes [[Disadvantage]] on ranged attack rolls with weapons. It also extinguishes open flames and disperses fog. A flying creature in a strong wind must land at the end of its turn or fall. A strong wind in a desert can create a sandstorm that imposes Disadvantage on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks.

Swimming through deep water (more than 100 feet deep) presents additional challenges because of the water’s pressure and cold temperature. After each hour of swimming in deep water, a creature that lacks a [[Swimming|Swim Speed]] must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain 1 [[Exhaustion]] level.

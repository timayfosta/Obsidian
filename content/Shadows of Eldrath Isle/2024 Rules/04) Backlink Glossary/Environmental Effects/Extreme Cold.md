When the temperature is 0 degrees Fahrenheit (-17 degrees Celsius) or lower, a creature exposed to the extreme cold must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour or gain 1 [[Exhaustion]] level. Creatures that have [[Resistance]] or [[Immunity]] to Cold damage automatically succeed on the save.

#### Collapsing Roof
*Deadly Trap (Levels 1 - 4)*

**Trigger:** A creature crosses a trip wire
**Duration:** Instantaneous

This trap uses a trip wire to collapse an unstable section of ceiling. The trip wire is 3 inches off the ground and stretches between two weak supports that topple when the trip wire is pulled.

The first creature that crosses the trip wire causes the supports to topple and the unstable section of ceiling to collapse. Each creature beneath the unstable section of ceiling must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 11 (2d10) Bludgeoning damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. Rubble from the collapse turns the trapped area into [[Difficult Terrain]].

***Detect and Disarm.*** As a [[Search]] action, a creature can examine the trapped area and make a DC 11 Wisdom ([[Perception]]) check, detecting the trip wire and the unstable section of ceiling on a successful check. Once detected, the trip wire can be easily cut or avoided (no ability check required).

***At Higher Levels.*** You can scale the trap for higher levels by increasing the damage and the save DC, as shown in the following table

| Levels  | Bludgeoning Damage | Save DC |
| :-----: | :----------------: | :-----: |
| 5 - 10  |     22 (4d10)      |   15    |
| 11 - 16 |     55 (10d10)     |   17    |
| 17 - 20 |     99 (18d10)     |   19    |

### Actions

***Smother.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +5, reach 5 ft. *Hit:* 10 (2d6 + 3) Bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, the rug can give it the [[Grappled]] condition (escape DC 13) instead of dealing damage. Until the grapple ends, the target has the [[Blinded]] and [[Restrained]] conditions, is suffocating, and takes 10 (2d6 + 3) Bludgeoning damage at the start of each of its turns. The rug can smother only one creature at a time.

While grappling the target, the rug can't take this action, the rug halves the damage it takes (round down), and the target takes the same amount of damage.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The dragon makes three Rend attacks. It can replace one attack with a use of (A) Slowing Breath or (B) Spellcasting to cast *Mind Spike* (level 4 version).

***Rend.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +11, reach 10 ft. *Hit:* 17 (2d10 + 6) Slashing damage plus 4 (1d8) Acid damage.

***Acid Breath (Recharge 5-6).*** *Dexterity Saving Throw:* DC 18, each creature in an 60-foot-long, 5-footwide Line. *Failure:* 54 (12d8) Acid damage. *Success:* Half damage.

***Slowing Breath.*** *Constitution Saving Throw:* DC 18, each creature in a 60-foot Cone. *Failure:* The target can't take Reactions; its Speed is halved; and it can take either an action or a Bonus Action on its turn, not both. This effect lasts until the end of its next turn.

***Spellcasting.*** The dragon casts one of the following spells, requiring no Material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 17):

- **At Will:** *Detect Magic*, *Mind Spike* (level 4 version), *Minor Illusion*, *Shapechange* (Beast or Humanoid form only, no Temporary Hit Points gained from the spell, and no Concentration or Temporary Hit Points required to maintain the spell)
- **1/Day Each:** *Greater Restoration*, *Major Image*

Until the end of its next turn, the target rolls 1d6 whenever it makes an ability check or attack roll and subtracts the number rolled from the D20 Test. *Failure or Success:* The dragon can't take this action again until the start of its next turn.

***Mind Jolt.*** The dragon uses Spellcasting to cast *Mind Spike* (level 4 version). The dragon can't take this action again until the start of its next turn.

***Pounce.*** The dragon moves up to half its Speed, and it makes one Rend attack.

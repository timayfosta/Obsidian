### Traits

***Ethereal Sight.*** The spider can see 60 feet into the Ethereal Plane while on the Material Plane and vice versa.

***Spider Climb.*** The spider can climb difficult surfaces, including along ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

***Web Walker.*** The spider ignores movement restrictions caused by webs, and the spider knows the location of any other creature in contact with the same web.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The spider makes two Bite attacks.

***Bite.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +5, reach 5 ft. *Hit:* 8 (1d10 + 3) Piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) Poison damage. If this damage reduces the target to 0 Hit Points, the target becomes Stable, and it has the [[Poisoned]] condition for 1 hour. While Poisoned, the target also has the [[Paralyzed]] condition.

### Bonus Actions

***Ethereal Jaunt.*** The spider teleports from the Material Plane to the Ethereal Plane or vice versa.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The dragon makes three Rend attacks. It can replace one attack with a use of (A) Spellcasting to cast *Guiding Bolt* (level 4 version) or (B) Weakening Breath.

***Rend.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +17 to hit, reach 15 ft. *Hit:* 19 (2d8 + 10) Slashing damage plus 9 (2d8) Fire damage.

***Fire Breath (Recharge 5-6).*** *Dexterity Saving Throw:* DC 24, each creature in a 90-foot Cone. *Failure:* 71 (13d10) Fire damage. *Success:* Half damage.

***Spellcasting.*** The dragon casts one of the following spells, requiring no Material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 24, +16 to hit with spell attacks):

- **At Will:** *Detect Magic*, *Guiding Bolt* (level 4 version), *Shapechange* (Beast or Humanoid form only, no Temporary Hit Points gained from the spell, and no Concentration or Temporary Hit Points required to maintain the spell)
- **1/Day Each:** *Flame Strike* (level 6 version), *Word of Recall*, *Zone of Truth*

***Weakening Breath.*** *Strength Saving Throw:* DC 24, each creature that isn't currently affected by this breath in a 90-foot Cone. *Failure:* The target has Disadvantage on Strength-based D20 Tests and subtracts 5 (1d10) from its damage rolls. It repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. After 1 minute, it succeeds automatically.

### Legendary Actions

*Legendary Action Uses: 3 (4 in Lair). Immediately after another creature's turn, the dragon can expend a use to take one of the following actions. The dragon regains all expended uses at the start of each of its turns.*

***Banish.*** *Charisma Saving Throw:* DC 24, one creature the dragon can see within 120 feet. *Failure:* 24 (7d6) Force damage, and the target has the [[Incapacitated]] condition and is transported to a harmless demiplane until the start of the dragon's next turn, at which point it reappears in an unoccupied space of the dragon's choice within 120 feet of the dragon. *Failure or Success:* The dragon can't take this action again until the start of its next turn.

***Guiding Light.*** The dragon uses Spellcasting to cast *Guiding Bolt* (level 4 version).

***Pounce.*** The dragon moves up to half its Speed, and it makes one Rend attack.

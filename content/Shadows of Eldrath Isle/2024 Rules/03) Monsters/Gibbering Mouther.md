### Traits

***Aberrant Ground.*** The ground in a 10-foot Emanation originating from the mouther is Difficult Terrain.

***Gibbering.*** The mouther babbles incoherently while it doesn't have the [[Incapacitated]] condition. *Wisdom Saving Throw:* DC 10, any creature that starts its turn within 20 feet of the mouther while it is babbling. *Failure:* The target rolls 1d8 to determine what it does during the current turn:

**1-4.** The target does nothing.
**5-6.** The target takes no action or Bonus Action and uses all its movement to move in a random direction.
**7-8.** The target makes a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach or does nothing if it can't make such an attack.

### Actions

***Bite.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +2, reach 5 ft. *Hit:* 7 (2d6) Piercing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it has the [[Prone]] condition. The target dies if it is reduced to 0 Hit Points by this attack. Its body is then absorbed into the mouther, leaving only equipment behind.

***Blinding Spittle (Recharge 5-6).*** *Dexterity Saving Throw:* DC 10, each creature in a 10-foot-radius Sphere centered on a point within 30 feet. *Failure:* 7 (2d6) Radiant damage, and the target has the [[Blinded]] condition until the end of the mouther's next turn.

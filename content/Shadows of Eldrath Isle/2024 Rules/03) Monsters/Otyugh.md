***Multiattack.*** The otyugh makes one Bite attack and two Tentacle attacks.

***Bite.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +6, reach 5 ft. *Hit:* 12 (2d8 + 3) Piercing damage, and the target has the [[Poisoned]] condition. Whenever the Poisoned target finishes a Long Rest, it is subjected to the following effect. *Constitution Saving Throw:* DC 15. *Failure:* The target's Hit Point maximum decreases by 5 (1d10) and doesn't return to normal until the Poisoned condition ends on the target. *Success:* The Poisoned condition ends.

***Tentacle.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +6, reach 10 ft. *Hit:* 12 (2d8 + 3) Piercing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it has the [[Grappled]] condition (escape DC 13) from one of two tentacles.

***Tentacle Slam.*** *Constitution Saving Throw:* DC 14, each creature [[Grappled]] by the otyugh. *Failure:* 16 (3d8 + 3) Bludgeoning damage, and the target has the [[Stunned]] condition until the start of the otyugh's next turn. *Success:* Half damage only.

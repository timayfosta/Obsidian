### Actions

***Gore.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +8, reach 5 ft. *Hit:* 18 (2d12 + 5) Piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature and the gorgon moved 20+ feet straight toward it immediately before the hit, the target has the [[Prone]] condition.

***Petrifying Breath (Recharge 5-6).*** *Constitution Saving Throw:* DC 15, each creature in a 30-foot Cone. *First Failure:* The target has the [[Restrained]] condition and repeats the save at the end of its next turn if it is still Restrained, ending the effect on itself on a success. *Second Failure:* The target has the [[Petrified]] condition instead of the Restrained condition.

### Bonus Actions

***Trample.*** *Dexterity Saving Throw:* DC 16, one creature within 5 feet that has the [[Prone]] condition. *Failure:* 16 (2d10 + 5) Bludgeoning damage. *Success:* Half damage.

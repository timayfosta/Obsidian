### Traits

***Amorphous.*** The jelly can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch without expending extra movement to do so.

***Spider Climb.*** The jelly can climb difficult surfaces, including along ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

### Actions

***Pseudopod.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +4, reach 5 ft. *Hit:* 12 (3d6 + 2) Acid damage.

### Reactions

***Split.*** *Trigger:* While the jelly is Large or Medium and has 10+ Hit Points, it becomes Bloodied or is subjected to Lightning or Slashing damage. *Response:* The jelly splits into two new **Ochre Jellies**. Each new jelly is one size smaller than the original jelly and acts on its Initiative. The original jelly's Hit Points are divided evenly between the new jellies (round down).

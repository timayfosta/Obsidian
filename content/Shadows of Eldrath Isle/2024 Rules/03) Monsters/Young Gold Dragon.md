***Fire Breath (Recharge 5-6).*** *Dexterity Saving Throw:* DC 17, each creature in a 30-foot Cone. *Failure:* 55 (10d10) Fire damage. *Success:* Half damage.

***Weakening Breath.*** *Strength Saving Throw:* DC 17, each creature that isn't currently affected by this breath in a 30-foot Cone. *Failure:* The target has Disadvantage on Strength-based D20 Tests and subtracts 3 (1d6) from its damage rolls.

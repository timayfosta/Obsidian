### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The gladiator makes three Spear attacks. It can replace one attack with a use of Shield Bash.

***Spear.*** *Melee or Ranged Attack Roll:* +7, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft. *Hit:* 11 (2d6 + 4) Piercing damage.

***Shield Bash.*** *Strength Saving Throw:* DC 15, one creature within 5 feet that the gladiator can see. *Failure:* 9 (2d4 + 4) Bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it has the [[Prone]] condition.

### Reactions

***Parry.*** *Trigger:* The gladiator is hit by a melee attack roll while holding a weapon. *Response:* The gladiator adds 3 to its AC against that attack, possibly causing it to miss.

### Traits

***Pack Tactics.*** The werewolf has Advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the werewolf's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally doesn't have the [[Incapacitated]] condition.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The werewolf makes two attacks, using Scratch or Longbow in any combination. It can replace one attack with a Bite attack.

***Bite (Wolf or Hybrid Form Only).*** *Melee Attack Roll:*  +5, reach 5 ft. *Hit:* 12 (2d8 + 3) Piercing damage. If the target is a Humanoid, it is subjected to the following effect. *Constitution Saving Throw:* DC 12. *Failure:*  The target is cursed. If the cursed target drops to 0 Hit Points, it instead becomes a **Werewolf** under the GM's control and has 10 Hit Points. *Success:* The target is immune to this werewolf's curse for 24 hours.

***Scratch.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +5, reach 5 ft. *Hit:* 10 (2d6 + 3) Slashing damage.

### Bonus Actions

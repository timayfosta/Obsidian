### Traits

***Iron Scent.*** The rust monster can pinpoint the location of ferrous metal within 30 feet of itself.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The rust monster makes one Bite attack and uses Antennae twice.

***Bite.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +3, reach 5 ft. *Hit:* 5 (1d8 + 1) Piercing damage.

***Antennae.*** The rust monster targets one nonmagical metal object — armor or a weapon — worn or carried by a creature within 5 feet of itself. *Dexterity Saving Throw:* DC 11, the creature with the object. *Failure:*  The object takes a -1 penalty to the AC it offers (armor) or to its attack rolls (weapon). Armor is destroyed if the penalty reduces its AC to 10, and a weapon is destroyed if its penalty reaches -5. The penalty can be removed by casting the *Mending* spell on the armor or weapon.

***Destroy Metal.*** The rust monster touches a nonmagical metal object within 5 feet of itself that isn't being worn or carried. The touch destroys a 1-foot Cube of the object.

### Reactions

***Reflexive Antennae.*** *Trigger:* An attack roll hits the rust monster. *Response:* The rust monster uses Antennae.

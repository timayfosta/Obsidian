***Diabolical Restoration.*** If the devil dies outside the Nine Hells, its body disappears in sulfurous smoke, and it gains a new body instantly, reviving with all its Hit Points somewhere in the Nine Hells.

***Magic Resistance.*** The devil has Advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

### Actions

***Ice Spear.*** *Melee or Ranged Attack Roll:* +10, reach 5 ft. or range 30/120 ft. *Hit:* 14 (2d8 + 5) Piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) Cold damage. Until the end of its next turn, the target can't take a Bonus Action or Reaction, its Speed decreases by 10 feet, and it can move or take one action on its turn, not both. *Hit or Miss:* The spear magically returns to the devil's hand immediately after a ranged attack.

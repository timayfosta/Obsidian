### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The dragon makes three Rend attacks. It can replace one attack with a use of (A) Paralyzing Breath or (B) Spellcasting to cast *Ice Knife* (level 2 version).

***Rend.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +17, reach 15 ft. *Hit:* 19 (2d8 + 10) Slashing damage plus 9 (2d8) Cold damage.

***Cold Breath (Recharge 5-6).*** *Constitution Saving Throw:* DC 24, each creature in a 90-foot Cone. *Failure:* 67 (15d8) Cold damage. *Success:* Half damage.

***Paralyzing Breath.*** *Constitution Saving Throw:* DC 24, each creature in a 90-foot Cone. *First Failure:* The target has the [[Incapacitated]] condition until the end of its next turn, when it repeats the save. *Second Failure:* The target has the [[Paralyzed]] condition, and it repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. After 1 minute, it succeeds automatically.

***Spellcasting.*** The dragon casts one of the following spells, requiring no Material components and using Charisma as the spellcasting ability (spell save DC 23, +15 to hit with spell attacks):

- **At Will:** *Detect Magic*, *Hold Monster*, *Ice Knife* (level 2 version), *Shapechange* (Beast or Humanoid form only, no Temporary Hit Points gained from the spell, and no Concentration or Temporary Hit Points required to maintain the spell)
- **1/Day Each:** *Control Weather*, *Ice Storm* (level 7 version), *Teleport*, *Zone of Truth*

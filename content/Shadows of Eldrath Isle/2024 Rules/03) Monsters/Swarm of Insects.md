### Traits

***Spider Climb.*** If the swarm has a Climb Speed, the swarm can climb difficult surfaces, including along ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

***Swarm.*** The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny insect. The swarm can't regain Hit Points or gain Temporary Hit Points.

### Actions

***Bites.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +3, reach 5 ft. *Hit:* 6 (2d4 + 1) Poison damage, or 3 (1d4 + 1) Poison damage if the swarm is Bloodied.

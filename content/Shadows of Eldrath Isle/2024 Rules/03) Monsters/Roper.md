### Traits

***Spider Climb.*** The roper can climb difficult surfaces, including along ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The roper makes two Tentacle attacks, uses Reel, and makes two Bite attacks.

***Bite.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +7, reach 5 ft. *Hit:* 17 (3d8 + 4) Piercing damage.

***Tentacle.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +7, reach 60 ft. *Hit:* The target has the [[Grappled]] condition (escape DC 14) from one of six tentacles, and the target has the [[Poisoned]] condition until the grapple ends.

The tentacle can be damaged, freeing a creature it has [[Grappled]] when destroyed (AC 20, HP 10, Immunity to Poison and Psychic damage). Damaging the tentacle deals no damage to the roper, and a destroyed tentacle regrows at the start of the roper's next turn.

***Reel.*** The roper pulls each creature [[Grappled]] by it up to 30 feet straight toward it.

## The Genesis Era:

### Creation and Foundations of Eldrath Isle

- **-10,000 DR (Age of Creation):** The primordial forces of Toril shape the world under the watchful eyes of the deities. Ao the Overgod oversees the balance, while Silvanus (the Forest Father) and Chauntea (the Earthmother) collaborate to birth Eldrath Isle from the volcanic seas southeast of Kara-Tur . Infused with Feywild essence by the Seelie Court and shadowed by the Shadowfell 's gloom, the isle emerges as a mist-shrouded sanctuary of natural harmony. The Heartstone , a crystalline artifact of pure elemental essence, forms at its core, acting as the isle's "heart" to maintain balance between earth, air, fire, water, and spirit. Minor deities like Eldath (Goddess of Peace) bless its waters, ensuring initial tranquility.
- **-9,500 DR (First Blessings):** Eldath blesses the isle's misty marshes with healing springs, while Corellon Larethian guides elven scouts from Evermeet to establish highland enclaves. Dryads awaken, forming the first nature pacts.
- **-9,000 DR (Elemental Songs Composed):** Fey bards, inspired by the Seldarine , sing the Seven Harmonies into existence—ancient songs attuning nature: Song of the Gale, Song of the Ember, Song of the Tide, Song of the Root, Song of the Gleam, Song of the Depths, Song of the Crag.
- **-8,500 DR (First Inhabitants):** Fey creatures from the Feywild migrate to Eldrath through natural portals, establishing ethereal groves. Elven wanderers from Evermeet , guided by Corellon Larethian (Creator of the Elves), settle the isle's highlands, blending with dryads and treants. The first minor event: A prophecy etched into the Heartstone by an unknown seer foretells, "When the heart shatters fivefold, four souls from distant waves shall mend it, ascending as winged guardians against the void's eternal hunger." This becomes known as the Prophecy of the Shattered Heart .
- **-8,000 DR (Guardian Council Forms):** A council of primordial elementals swears oaths to Silvanus , embedding protective wards around the Heartstone .
- **-7,500 DR (Volcanic Forging):** Kossuth 's influence triggers eruptions, sculpting diverse biomes and infusing the land with latent fire magic.
- **-7,000 DR (Elemental Awakening):** Volcanic eruptions, influenced by Kossuth (Lord of Fire), forge the isle's diverse biomes: misty marshes, aerial spires, and shadowed valleys. The Seven Harmonies —a set of ancient elemental songs—are sung into existence by bardic fey spirits, embedding magical resonances in the land. Minor event: The first guardians, a council of elementals, swear oaths to Silvanus to protect the Heartstone from imbalance.

## The Era of Fracture Songs:

### Conflicts and Prophecies

- **-5,000 DR (Shadowfell Incursion):** Tendrils of the Shadowfell bleed into Eldrath , corrupting pockets of land with Blight —a necrotic plague. Shar (Goddess of Darkness and Loss) subtly influences this, testing the isle's resilience. Major event: The War of Whispering Shadows erupts as fey allies rally under Mielikki (Goddess of Forests) to repel shadow demons.

Led by precursors to Grimthar , they establish hoards in the marshes. Minor war: The Marsh Skirmishes see elven rangers and fey druids push back the invaders, but not before the ogres steal elemental shards, disrupting the Seven Harmonies . Sylva 's ancestral line begins here as scout-heroes.
- **-2,500 DR (Draconic Arrival):** Shadow dragon Drakthar , fleeing Tiamat 's wars in Faerûn , burrows into volcanic depths, entering torpor and warping local ley lines.
- **-2,000 DR (Dragon's Slumber):** A shadow dragon, Drakthar, flees Faerûn 's dragon wars (influenced by Tiamat , Queen of Evil Dragons) and burrows into Eldrath 's volcanic core, entering torpor. Its presence warps local magic, awakening latent flames. Minor event: Herbalist forebears discover flame-resistant herbs, founding a lineage of nature wardens blessed by Chauntea.
- **-1,800 DR (Fey Court Schisms):** Unseelie intrigue brews; Queen Vespera, an archfey illusionist, claims mist-shrouded peaks.
- **-1,500 DR (Fey Court Intrigue):** Queen Vespera, an archfey of illusions tied to the Unseelie Court, establishes the Mirror Veil —a deceptive realm within the isle's mists. Influenced by the chaotic whims of the Feywild no specific deity, but echoing the freedom of Corellon), she weaves alternate fates into mirrors. Major event: The Veil Deceptions , a cold war of illusions, where fey factions vie for control, leading to the Prophecy's expansion: "Shards of deception shall reveal truths, but only through collective sight."

- **-500 DR (Giant Exile):** Storm giants, exiled from their cloud citadels during mainland conflicts (worshippers of Stronmaus , God of Storm Giants, though not directly involved), settle Eldrath's aerial peaks. Rhivak , a warlord among them, begins amassing an armada. Minor event: The Eternal Veil forms as a storm barrier, prophesied to grant "stormwings" to worthy unifiers in the final verse of the Shattered Heart Prophecy .

### Build-Up to the Campaign

### Pantheon of Eldrath Isle

The pantheon of Eldrath Isle draws exclusively from the deities of Toril as presented in the 2014 D&D 5th Edition core rules (Player's Handbook, Dungeon Master's Guide, and Monster Manual). These gods are revered on the isle due to its unique blend of Feywild vibrancy, Shadowfell gloom, volcanic fury, and elemental harmonies. The Heartstone artifact is seen as a divine nexus, channeling their influences to maintain the isle's balance. Worship is decentralized, with small druidic circles, elven enclaves, and giant clans forming the core faithful. Deities are often invoked in rituals tied to the Seven Harmonies, self-discovery, destiny, and sacrifice.

Below is the core pantheon, selected for their alignment with Eldrath's themes. Each entry includes the deity's purpose on the isle, a brief description, and example worshipper groups.

#### Worship and Cultural Notes

- **Overarching Faith**: Most islanders practice a syncretic worship, blending deities in Heartstone rituals. The Prophecy of the Shattered Heart is seen as a divine mandate from Ao (the Overgod, mentioned in passing as the balancer of all), though he receives no direct cults.
- **Group Dynamics**: Worshipper groups often overlap (e.g., a ranger might honor Mielikki and Silvanus). Conflicts arise between Shar's shadowy cults and light-aligned orders, mirroring the isle's Blight vs. harmony theme.
- **Rituals**: Common practices include elemental songs (tied to harmonies), sacrificial offerings (time, possessions, or symbolic deaths), and group meditations for self-discovery.

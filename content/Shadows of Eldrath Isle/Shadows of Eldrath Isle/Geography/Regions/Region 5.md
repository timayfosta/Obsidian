  
#### Aerial Spires & Floating Peaks: Detailed Breakdown

The **Aerial Spires & Floating Peaks**, known as the **Sky-Touched Heights**, crown the northwestern highlands of Eldrath Isle, encompassing about 60–80 square miles of vertiginous, wind-lashed terrain at elevations of 5,000–10,000 feet. This biome features colossal rock spires piercing the clouds, vast wind-swept plateaus, and clusters of levitating stone islands suspended by ancient fey magic and perpetual updrafts. Massive storm clouds swirl eternally, crackling with lightning, while razor-sharp gales carve the stone into fantastical shapes. Nesting aarakocra, harpies, and storm giant outposts dot the heights, and the resounding **Wind's Whisper** harmony echoes in the howling winds. This is Rhivak's domain, where aerial rifts to the Elemental Plane of Air threaten to unleash chaos, making it the pinnacle of the party's ascension.

#### Geography and Environment

- **Climate and Weather**: Fierce and unpredictable (30–60°F, dropping lower at night); constant high winds (difficult terrain for non-fliers, DC 14 Str save or pushed 20 ft.). Thunderstorms rage 70% of the time, with lightning strikes (DC 15 Dex save or 4d10 lightning damage).
- **Flora**: Adapted to heights — **cloudmoss** (glowing lichen that grants feather fall for 1 minute when eaten), **windwhip vines** (lash out in gusts, DC 13 Dex save or restrained), and **stormpetal orchids** (flowers that predict weather, advantage on Survival checks for storms).
- **Fauna and Hazards**:
    
    |Creature/Hazard|CR/Level|Description & Encounter Hook|
    |---|---|---|
    |**Storm Harpies** (harpy w/ lightning aura)|3|Flocks (6–10) with electrified songs (DC 14 Wis save or charmed + shocked).|
    |**Aarakocra Raiders**|1/4|Scout bands (8–12); neutral but raid intruders; can be allied via quests.|
    |**Air Elementals**|5|Whirlwind guardians of rifts; summon storms in combat.|
    |**Gale Shears**|-|Wind blades (DC 15 Dex save or 3d6 slashing + knocked prone).|
    |**Lightning Rods**|-|Natural spires attract bolts (DC 14 Con save or stunned 1 round).|
    
- **Magic and Ley Lines**: Potent **Wind's Whisper** resonance; air spells +10 ft. range and speed. Rifts allow planar summons (risky backlash).
- **Travel**: Aerial only viable (flying mounts or spells essential); spire climbs (DC 16 Athletics), wind tunnels (DC 15 Acrobatics). Random encounters every 1–2 hours, emphasizing flight combat.

This biome suits **levels 14–20 aerial warfare and faction diplomacy** (focus in Books 4–5): vertigo-inducing heights, storm battles, and unification quests.

#### Settlements

Sparse and elevated — total population ~700 giants, aarakocra, cloud giants, and wind-worshipping humans. Structures are carved into spires or perched on floating isles, honoring Stronmaus.

### Shadowed Marshes & Swamps: Detailed Breakdown

The **Shadowed Marshes & Swamps** form the dark, low-lying heart of Eldrath Isle's southwestern interior, a sprawling, fog-choked wetland covering roughly 80–100 square miles. This biome is the epicenter of **Blight corruption**, where Shadowfell influence has seeped deepest through ancient rifts, twisting vibrant life into necrotic decay. Dense stands of black mangroves rise from brackish water, their roots forming labyrinthine tangles that hide sinking ruins and ogre hoards. The air hangs heavy with the stench of rot, the croak of corrupted amphibians, and the distant, eerie whispers of the **Shadow's Veil** harmony. Blight pools bubble with necrotic energy, spawning undead and twisted flora, while illusory mirages (echoes of Queen Vespera's Veil) blend with the natural fog to deceive travelers.

#### Geography and Environment

- **Climate and Weather**: Perpetual twilight under a thick canopy of twisted vines; visibility rarely exceeds 20–40 feet. Humidity near 100%, with frequent acidic rain (1d4 acid damage per hour if exposed without shelter). Temperatures 60–75°F, but feels colder due to necrotic chill.
- **Flora**: Blighted mangroves (roots entangle, DC 14 Str save or restrained); necrotic lilies (release spores, DC 13 Con save or poisoned for 1 hour); rare **shadowbloom** (black flowers that grant _darkvision_ 60 ft. for 1 hour when crushed, but attract Blight minions).
- **Fauna and Hazards**:
    
    |Creature/Hazard|CR/Level|Description & Encounter Hook|
    |---|---|---|
    |**Blighted Will-o’-Wisps** (will-o’-wisp w/ necrotic damage)|3|Lure travelers into quicksand (DC 14 Wis save vs. illusion); drain life (extra 2d6 necrotic).|
    |**Swamp Trolls** (troll w/ regeneration in water)|5|Ogre-allied trolls guard hoards; regenerate 20 HP/turn in Blight water.|
    |**Blight Oozes** (black pudding variant)|4|Corrosive puddles that dissolve armor (AC reduction); hide in pools.|
    |**Quicksand Bogs**|-|DC 13 Str (Athletics) to escape; failure deals 2d6 bludgeoning + sink deeper.|
    |**Necrotic Mists**|-|Periodic clouds (DC 12 Con save or 1 level exhaustion + 1d6 necrotic damage).|
    
- **Magic and Ley Lines**: Strong **Shadow's Veil** and **Water's Lament** resonances; necrotic magic amplifies (spells with necrotic damage +1d6). Heartstone shards pulse here, drawing Blight.
- **Travel**: Wading (half speed), canoe paths (DC 13 Survival to navigate), or vine bridges (DC 14 Acrobatics). Random encounters every 2–4 hours.

This biome is designed for **levels 3–8 exploration/combat** (major focus in Books 1–2): high danger, resource scarcity, and moral dilemmas (save corrupted villagers or burn Blight-infested areas?).

#### Settlements

The marshes support resilient, isolated communities of survivors—total population ~800 humans, half-orcs, lizardfolk, and Blight-resistant half-elves. Settlements are built on stilts or floating platforms; many are nomadic or fortified against Blight and Grimthar's ogre raids.

|Settlement Name|Size & Population|Description & Key NPCs|Campaign Role|
|---|---|---|---|

#### DM Tips for Running the Biome

- **Encounter Scaling**: For 4 PCs, use DMG XP budgets; add environmental hazards (+50% difficulty in deep marsh).
- **Exploration**: Random table: 1–2 Blight minions, 3–4 environmental trap, 5 ogre patrol, 6 ally/NPC encounter.
- **Themes**: Decay vs. resilience; sacrifice (burn corrupted areas to save others?); foreshadowing Grimthar’s tyranny.
- **Progression**: Clear minor Blight → ally with settlements → assault Grimthar’s hoard.

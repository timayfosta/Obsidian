### Misty Coastal Shores & Beaches: Detailed Breakdown

The **Misty Coastal Shores & Beaches** form the rugged, fog-enshrouded gateway to Eldrath Isle, stretching along the island's southeastern perimeter where the Endless Mists (a perpetual veil of Feywild-tinged fog) clash with the churning Sea of Storms. This biome spans approximately 50 miles of jagged coastline, characterized by sheer basalt cliffs plunging into roiling waves, pebbled beaches littered with driftwood, and expansive tidal pools that shimmer with bioluminescent algae. The air is thick with salt spray, the distant roar of surf, and an eerie silence broken only by whispering winds—harbingers of the **Shadow's Veil** harmony. Blight corruption from the Shadowfell seeps in via tidal currents, twisting marine life into necrotic horrors, while illusory mirages (echoes of Queen Vespera's distant Veil) lure the unwary to their doom.

#### Geography and Environment

- **Climate and Weather**: Constant low-lying mists reduce visibility to 30-60 feet (mechanically, _fog cloud_ effect in combat). Sudden squalls bring heavy rain and 40-ft. waves; temperatures hover at 50-65°F, chilling and damp. Lunar tides (influenced by Selûne) cause extreme high tides that flood beaches twice daily.
- **Flora**: Twisted kelp forests in shallows glow with **mistbloom** (healing herbs, DC 13 Survival to harvest for potions of healing). Inland: Fogroot mangroves (provide cover but entangle, DC 14 Athletics to escape) and whisperwillows (their leaves rustle prophecies, granting _augury_ once per long rest if burned).
- **Fauna and Hazards**:
    
    |Creature/Hazard|CR/Level|Description & Encounter Hook|
    |---|---|---|
    |**Blight Crabs** (custom: giant crab + blight template)|1/4|Swarms (4-8) attack scavengers; necrotic claws (extra 1d4 poison). Book 1 opener fight.|
    |**Mist Wolves** (dire wolf w/ _misty step_ 1/day)|1|Pack hunters (3-5) that phase through fog; howl imposes fear (DC 12 Wis save).|
    |**Illusory Sirens** (harpy w/ illusion spells)|1|Lure with deceptive songs; lead to cliffs (DC 14 Int save or fall 2d6 damage).|
    |**Tidal Pools**|-|Trap: Sinking quicksand (DC 13 Str save); hide pearl caches (500 gp value).|
    |**Blight Tide** (environmental)|-|Periodic waves spread DC 12 Con save poison; failure inflicts 1 level exhaustion.|
    
- **Magic and Ley Lines**: Subtle **Water's Lament** resonance in pools allows water-based rituals (e.g., _create or destroy water_ at advantage). Heartstone shards amplify here during Book 1 climax.
- **Travel**: Narrow cliff paths (DC 12 Acrobatics or fall); hidden smugglers' trails. Sea travel risky (DC 15 Survival navigation).

This biome is ideal for **levels 1-3 survival/exploration** (8-12 sessions in Book 1): resource scarcity (rations spoil in 1d4 days), random encounters (1d6 table), and foreshadowing (Blight minions whisper Void Whisperer taunts).

#### Settlements

The coastal shores host sparse, hardy communities of fisherfolk, herbalists, and scavengers—total population ~1,200 humans, half-elves, and fey-touched. No true cities; settlements cling to coves for protection. Blight raids force frequent relocations. All worship **Eldath** (peaceful waters) and **Valkur** (sea protection), with Mielikki shrines for rangers.

#### DM Tips for Running the Biome

- **Encounter Scaling**: For 4 PCs, use DMG XP budgets; add environmental hazards (+25% difficulty).
- **Exploration**: Random table: 1-2 fog mirage, 3-4 wildlife, 5 Blight ambush, 6 ally/NPC.
- **Themes**: Isolation breeds paranoia; mists symbolize self-discovery (amnesia hook).
- **Progression**: Clear Blight → unlock settlements → Heartstone trail inland.

# Food and Water

Characters who don't eat or drink suffer the effects of [exhaustion](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#exhaustion_phb) (see the appendix). Exhaustion caused by lack of food or water can't be removed until the character eats and drinks the full required amount.

## Food

A character needs one pound of food per day and can make food last longer by subsisting on half rations. Eating half a pound of food in a day counts as half a day without food.

A character can go without food for a number of days equal to 3 + his or her Constitution modifier (minimum 1). At the end of each day beyond that limit, a character automatically suffers one level of [exhaustion](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#exhaustion_phb).

A normal day of eating resets the count of days without food to zero.

## Water

A character needs one gallon of water per day, or two gallons per day if the weather is hot. A character who drinks only half that much water must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of [exhaustion](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#exhaustion_phb) at the end of the day. A character with access to even less water automatically suffers one level of [exhaustion](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#exhaustion_phb) at the end of the day.

If the character already has one or more levels of [exhaustion](https://5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#exhaustion_phb), the character takes two levels in either case.

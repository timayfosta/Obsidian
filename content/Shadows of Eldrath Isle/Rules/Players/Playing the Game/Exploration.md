## Exploration 
Exploration involves delving into places that are dangerous and full of mystery. The rules in this section detail some of the ways adventurers interact with the environment in such places. 
### Adventuring Equipment 
As adventurers explore, their equipment can help them in many ways. For example, they can reach out-of-the-way places with a Ladder, perceive things they wouldn’t otherwise notice with a Torch or another light source, bypass locked doors and containers with Thieves' Tools , and create obstacles for pursuers with Caltrops . 
### Vision and Light 
Some adventuring tasks—such as noticing danger, hitting an enemy, and targeting certain spells—are affected by sight, so effects that obscure vision can hinder you, as explained below. 
#### Obscured Areas 
An area might be Lightly or Heavily Obscured. In a Lightly Obscured area—such as an area with Dim Light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage - you have Disadvantage on Wisdom ( Perception ) checks that rely on sight. 

A Heavily Obscured area - such as an area with Darkness, heavy fog, or dense foliage - is opaque. You have the Blinded condition when trying to see something there. 
#### Light 
The presence or absence of light determines the category of illumination in an area, as defined below. 

***Bright Light.*** Bright Light lets most creatures see normally. Even gloomy days provide Bright Light, as do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources of illumination within a specific radius. 

***Dim Light.*** Dim Light, also called shadows, creates a Lightly Obscured area. An area of Dim Light is usually a boundary between Bright Light and surrounding Darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts as Dim Light. A full moon might bathe the land in Dim Light. 

***Darkness.*** Darkness creates a Heavily Obscured area. Characters face Darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit nights), within the confines of an unlit dungeon, or in an area of magical Darkness. 
### Special Senses 
Some creatures have special senses that help them perceive things in certain situations.

##### Blindsight 
A monster with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius.
Creatures without eyes, such as grimlocks and gray oozes, typically have this special sense, as do creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and true dragons.
If a monster is naturally blind, it has a parenthetical note to this effect, indicating that the radius of its blindsight defines the maximum range of its perception.
##### Darkvision 
A monster with darkvision can see in the dark within a specific radius. The monster can see in dim light within the radius as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. The monster can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. Many creatures that live underground have this special sense.
##### Tremorsense 
A monster with tremorsense can detect and pinpoint the origin of vibrations within a specific radius, provided that monster and the source of the vibrations are in contact with the same ground or substance. Tremorsense can't be used to detect flying or incorporeal creatures. 
##### Truesight
A creature with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceives the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic. Furthermore, the creature can see into the Ethereal Plane.

### Hiding 
Adventurers and monsters often hide, whether to spy on one another, sneak past a guardian, or set an ambush. The Game Master decides when circumstances are appropriate for hiding. When you try to hide, you take the Hide action. 
### Interacting with Objects 
Interacting with objects is often simple to resolve. The player tells the GM that their character is doing something, such as moving a lever or opening a door, and the GM describes what happens. Sometimes, however, rules govern what you can do with an object, as detailed in the following sections. 
#### What Is an Object? 
For the purpose of the rules, an object is a discrete, inanimate item like a window, door, sword, book, table, chair, or stone. It isn’t a building or a vehicle, which are composed of many objects. 
#### Time-Limited Object Interactions 
When time is short, such as in combat, interactions with objects are limited: one free interaction per turn. That interaction must occur during a creature’s movement or action. Any additional interactions require the Utilize action. 
#### Finding Hidden Objects 
When your character searches for hidden things, such as a secret door or a trap, the GM typically asks you to make a Wisdom ( Perception ) check, provided you describe the character searching in the hidden object’s vicinity. On a success, you find the object, other important details, or both. 

If you describe your character searching nowhere near a hidden object, a Wisdom (Perception) check won’t reveal the object, no matter the check’s total. 
#### Carrying Objects 
You can usually carry your gear and treasure without worrying about the weight of those objects. If you try to haul an unusually heavy object or a massive number of lighter objects, the GM might require you to abide by the rules for Carrying Capacity|carrying capacity .
#### Breaking Objects 
As an action, you can automatically break or otherwise destroy a fragile, nonmagical object, such as a glass container or a piece of paper. If you try to damage something more resilient, the GM might use the rules on Breaking Objects|breaking objects .
### Hazards 
Monsters are the main perils characters face, but other dangers await.
##### Burning 
 A burning creature or object takes 1d4 Fire damage at the start of each of its turns. As an action, you can extinguish fire on yourself by giving yourself the prone condition and rolling on the ground. The fire also goes out if it is doused, submerged, or suffocated.
##### Dehydration
 A character needs one gallon of water per day, or two gallons per day if the weather is hot. A character who drinks only half that much water must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion at the end of the day. A character with access to even less water automatically suffers one level of exhaustion at the end of the day.
 
 If the character already has one or more levels of exhaustion, the character takes two levels in either case.
 Falling 
 
##### Malnutrition
 A character needs one pound of food per day and can make food last longer by subsisting on half rations. Eating half a pound of food in a day counts as half a day without food.

A character can go without food for a number of days equal to 3 + his or her Constitution modifier (minimum 1). At the end of each day beyond that limit, a character automatically suffers one level of exhaustion.

A normal day of eating resets the count of days without food to zero
#### Suffocating
A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds).

When a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 round). At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying, and it can't regain hit points or be stabilized until it can breathe again.

For example, a creature with a Constitution of 14 can hold its breath for 3 minutes. If it starts suffocating, it has 2 rounds to reach air before it drops to 0 hit points.
#### Falling
- **Damage:** 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10 feet fallen to a maximum of 20d6 and you land prone unless you somehow avoid damage.
- **Great Height Fall**: You instantly fall up to 500ft. If you're still falling next turn you descend up to 500ft at the end of that turn. It continues until you hit the ground or are otherwise halted.
- **Falling with Flying**: While in flight, you fall if you are: knocked prone, speed reduced to 0ft, lose the ability to move unless you can hover, or are held magically. 
	- If knocked prone and still conscious, subtract your movement speed from fall distance before calculating damage. All other rules apply.






### Travel 
During an adventure, the characters might travel long distances on trips that could take hours or days. The GM can summarize this travel without calculating exact distances or travel times, or the GM might have you use the travel pace rules below. 

> [!tip] Marching Order
> The adventurers should establish a marching order while they travel, whether indoors or outdoors. A marching order makes it easier to determine which characters are affected by traps, which ones can spot hidden enemies, and which ones are the closest to those enemies if a fight breaks out. You can change your marching order outside combat and record the order any way you like: write it down, for example, or arrange miniatures to show it.
#### Travel Pace 
While traveling outside combat, a group can move at a Fast, Normal, or Slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace table. The table states how far the party can move in a period of time; if riding horses or other mounts, the group can move twice that distance for 1 hour, after which the mounts need a Short Rest|Short or Long Rest before they can move at that increased pace again.

###### Travel Pace 

| Pace | Minute | Hour | Day |
|-|-|-|-|
| Fast | 400 feet | 4 miles | 30 miles |
| Normal | 300 feet | 3 miles | 24 miles |
| Slow | 200 feet | 2 miles | 18 miles |

Each travel pace has a game effect, as defined below. 

***Fast.*** Traveling at a Fast pace imposes Disadvantage on a traveler’s Wisdom ( Perception or Survival ) and Dexterity ( Stealth ) checks. 

***Normal.*** Traveling at a Normal pace imposes Disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. 

***Slow.*** Traveling at a Slow pace grants Advantage on Wisdom (Perception or Survival) checks. 
#### Vehicles 
Travelers in wagons, carriages, or other land vehicles choose a pace as normal. Characters in a waterborne vessel are limited to the speed of the vessel, and they don’t choose a travel pace. Depending on the vessel and the size of the crew, ships might be able to travel for up to 24 hours per day.

> [!tip] Playing on a Grid 
> If you play using a square grid and miniatures or other tokens, follow these rules. Squares. Each square represents 5 feet. Speed. Rather than moving foot by foot, move square by square on the grid, using your Speed in 5-foot segments. You can translate your Speed into squares by dividing it by 5. For example, a Speed of 30 feet translates into 6 squares. If you use a grid often, consider writing your Speed in squares on your character sheet. Entering a Square. To enter a square, you must have enough movement left to pay for entering. It costs 1 square of movement to enter an unoccupied square that’s adjacent to your space (orthogonally or diagonally adjacent). A square of Difficult Terrain costs 2 squares to enter. Other effects might make a square cost even more. Corners. Diagonal movement can’t cross the corner of a wall, a large tree, or another terrain feature that fills its space. Ranges. To determine the range on a grid between two things—whether creatures or objects— count squares from a square adjacent to one of them and stop counting in the space of the other one. Count by the shortest route.

### Ability Scores 
Each ability has a score from 1 to 20, although some monsters have a score as high as 30. The score represents the magnitude of an ability. The Ability Scores table summarizes what the scores mean.

| 12 - 19 | This represents a strong capability. |

Each ability has a modifier that you apply whenever you make a D20 Test with that ability. An ability modifier is derived from its score, as shown in the Ability Modifiers table.

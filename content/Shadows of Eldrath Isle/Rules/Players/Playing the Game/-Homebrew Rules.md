_**These will be updated as things change and progress through the game**_

> [!Important]
>  Make sure you read ALL the rules for your characters and understand them. If there is something you don’t understand ask the DM and we will make and official ruling on it if I can’t find anything online to support it. Make sure your character is something you will actually roleplay. Doesn’t have to be a lot but give it a good try, try your HARDEST not to metagame. Hopefully this will get better as we progress through a story. 

Things to consider:

 - Not every person you try to talk to knows about a quest, some live quiet lives and don’t venture out. Some are only ever in town to eat and go to sleep. Keep this in mind when you are getting frustrated for not gathering information or getting quests. On the same note, not every room or area you are in is hiding something. Sometimes a room is just that, a boring, plain, simple room with nothing in it. That doesn’t mean don’t check, that just means don’t try to do the same thing over and over.

- Don’t think too hard about what could have happened if you did something differently. You will never know how the other way could have turned out.

- Remember, NPC’s are people too, if you interrupt them while they are talking or try to do something to them they may not talk to you, or may give you bad information, or still may be helpful, everyone is different. Not everyone is trusting of all people. Some don’t like adventurers, some are dishonest by nature.

> [!Reminder] 
> Leave your pride at the door, do your best to roleplay while you are in character, it adds to the fun of the game and helps differentiate when you are asking the DM something or your character doing something in game

As people are roleplaying do your best to pay attention, you never know what information you will be missing out on.

Just because you are in combat, doesn’t mean you have to fight. There may be ways to end combat without fighting or avoid it all together. Think outside the box on what you intend to do. You may be surprised by the results.

Uncut gems are worth 10x less than their cut counter parts, you will lose .25 carats of gem when cutting.

**Sprint**: During combat you can use your entire turn to sprint up to 5x your movement only in a straight line. You cannot use any other feat or ability, but you can still use reactions.

I will be adding some creatures that have variable AC and Damage depending on creatures. EXAMPLE: Swarm of insects, at full HP there ac will be 10 lets say and they will deal 3d6 damage. As their health goes down (i.e. some of the insects are killed off) then they ac will go up (they will be harder to hit) and the damage will go down (there are less of them to deal damage).

Will discuss Adding Travel Roles. Navigator, Scout, Defender and Utility. Anyone can pick any one of these and you can have more than one if your party wants. Navigators will use mostly survival checks to try and find a way through wherever you are traveling. Scouts are looking around mostly long distance and will mostly be using perception checks. Defend will keep an eye on close quarters and potential incoming enemies and will mostly be attack rolls or spell checks. Utility will be anything else (reading, keeping track of and NPC or pet, keeping items safe) One person will need to be the “leader” of the group for extra/special checks or saves that may arise.

When knocked prone, standing up no longer costs half your movement. It only cost 15ft, no matter what.

**Short rest** will now be 15 minutes of time.

**Long rest** will be 6 hours, and no longer fully heal everything. It will be in two 3 hour increments. At the beginning of the rest you can use any number of hit dice you have remaining, but only at the beginning of the long rest.  After the first 3 hours you will regain half of your maximum hit dice (rounded up). The second 3 hours your spell slots will reset fully.

**Full rest** can only be done is a safe area. Most likely with beds available. It will be spending 24 hours in a safe place with sleeping included. (e.g. a village or town) and will regain all hit dice, reset spell slots, and recover full hp. It won’t necessarily be “resting” the entire time. But spending non combat/ non work time in a safe place. There may be a chance of added temp HP depending on circumstances of the full rest. 

**Death Saves and Death**: We will try something different for this. When you get knocked unconscious and get revived (whether by succeeding in saves or magically), you automatically add 1 to  failed death save. Failed death saves will not fully reset until a Full rest has been completed. Each long rest will remove 1 failed death save. Also, death saves will be rolled by players. 

**New AC Rule**: If an attack is rolled it matches the armor class of the target, it will be considered a “glancing blow”. The damage will be dealt and half the roll a (glancing blow effect, if you will).

**Spell and Ability Saves**: We will add a “critical hit” for saves. On any save roll, whether spell or ability save. If a Natural one is rolled it will be considered a “critical hit” for that purpose and will deal double damage.

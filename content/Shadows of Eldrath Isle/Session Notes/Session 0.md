# Campaign Overview

## Eldrath Isle: Campaign Overview

### The Setting: Eldrath Isle

Eldrath Isle is a mist-shrouded, enchanted land lost in the far southeastern seas of Toril — beyond even the distant fringes of Kara-Tur and the Utter East. It is a place where the boundaries between the Material Plane, the Feywild, and the Shadowfell have grown thin. Ancient magic lingers in the air. The island is alive with wonder and danger:

- Towering volcanic peaks that breathe fire and ash
- Vast, trackless marshes glowing with strange fungi
- Windswept cliffs and floating stone isles drifting in the sky
- Deep primeval forests where the trees remember old songs
- and much more!

Here, nature itself is both ally and adversary. Balance is fragile. Corruption from the Shadowfell has begun to spread like a blight, twisting life into shadow.

### How Your Story Begins

Every character must have a reason for being aboard a ship bound eastward across the distant seas when disaster strikes. You awaken shipwrecked on Eldrath’s shores with fragmented memories, scattered gear, and a sense that the island _chose_ you.

**Ideas for why you were on the ship**: (You don't have to use any of these. You can come up with you own.)

- Merchant vessel crew or passenger seeking trade routes beyond Kara-Tur
- Explorer or scholar chasing rumors of a lost enchanted isle
- Exile, fugitive, or pilgrim fleeing trouble on the mainland
- Hired guard for a mysterious expedition
- Stowaway with a secret purpose
- Sailor on a doomed naval or privateer ship

Your gear and memories will be mostly intact after the wreck, but you’ll start fresh on the island with the party.

### Campaign Structure

The story unfolds across five "Chapters", each with its own arc, tone, and rewards. Levels progress smoothly from 1 to 20:

A very basic guideline is that each Chapter is roughly 8–20 sessions, blending exploration, combat, roleplay, puzzles, and environmental challenges.

### Core Themes & Tone

- Self-discovery and growth through adversity
- The balance (and cost) of nature’s power
- Destiny vs. choice
- Elemental mastery and harmony
- Sacrifice for something greater
- Found family among the party and a few recurring allies

The tone is epic yet personal — wondrous and perilous, with moments of beauty, horror, hope, and bittersweet victory.

### What to Expect

- Heavy emphasis on roleplay, exploration, and environmental storytelling
- Combat scaled for a party of 4 as best as possible. Anything possible from easy to deadly, depending on your actions throughout the campaign.
- Recurring NPC potential allies and enemies who grow alongside you
- A hopefully satisfying, earned epic conclusion

This is your heroes’ legend — written together on the living canvas of Eldrath Isle.
Ready your dice. The mists are waiting.

# Character Creation

### Core Rules & Sources

- **Allowed Books**: Any official books are fine (2014) only for races, classes, backgrounds, and feats. (We’ll introduce custom elements and boons later in the campaign.)
- **Level**: Start at **Level 1**.
- **Ability Scores**: Point buy (27 points) is preferred **or** roll if you'd like. With point buy, and 8 in your modifier cost 0 points.

| Score | Cost | Score | Cost |
| ----- | ---- | ----- | ---- |
| 9     | 1    | 15    | 9    |
| 10    | 2    | 16    | 11   |
| 11    | 3    | 17    | 14   |
| 12    | 4    | 18    | 17   |
| 13    | 5    | 19    | 20   |
| 14    | 7    | 20    | 23   |
- **Hit Points**: Maximum at 1st level; take the average (rounded up) or roll for subsequent levels.
- **Alignment**: Any, but keep in mind the campaign’s themes of self-discovery, nature’s balance, destiny, and sacrifice. Evil alignments may clash with the group’s heroic arc.
- **Starting Equipment**: As per your class and background. You may also start with one mundane trinket or keepsake from your homeland. Include at least one reason why you have it. (flavor only — no mechanical benefit).


### Backstory Elements to Include

Craft a backstory that ties you to the mainland but leaves room for growth and mystery on Eldrath. Focus on 2–3 key elements:

1. **Origin & Homeland** – Where on Toril are you from? How does your culture view magic, nature, or the sea? Look at the Toril world map, feel free to look up things about the different lands, or just make something completely up.
2. **Personal Motivation** – What drove you to sail east? (Ambition, redemption, curiosity, duty, escape?)
3. **A Secret or Mystery** – Something you haven’t told anyone: a lost memory, a family curse, a prophetic dream of mists and glowing stones, or a debt owed to a mysterious patron. Add at least one, but if you want to add more that is OK as well.
4. **Connection to Nature or Magic** – Optional but encouraged: a childhood bond with the wild, a latent gift you’ve never fully understood, or a traumatic encounter with corrupted magic. Be creative, if you need help ask. 


### Races & Classes

All PHB options are [[Welcome]], but these fit the campaign’s tone especially well:

**Races**:
Any race from official 2014 sources. If there is something you have question on, or to see how well it can fit into the story, feel free to ask. 
**Classes**:
Any class works — even a city-born rogue or scholarly wizard can discover a deep connection to the island’s magic. You can use any official 2014 source material.

### Bonds, Ideals, & Flaws

Choose or roll traits that tie into the campaign’s themes. Here are tailored suggestions:

**Ideals**:
- Balance: Nature must remain in equilibrium; disrupting it invites ruin for all.
- Growth: True strength comes from understanding and mastering oneself.
- Harmony: The elements, like people, thrive when they work in unison rather than conflict.
- Discovery: Hidden truths and forgotten powers are worth any risk to uncover.
- Sacrifice: The greatest good sometimes demands giving up what we hold most dear.
- Destiny: Some paths are written in the stars (or the mists); I will walk mine with open eyes.
- Redemption: Past mistakes can be atoned for through deeds that heal rather than destroy.
- Unity: No one survives alone; true power lies in the bonds we forge with others.
- Preservation: Ancient wonders and wild places must be protected from corruption and greed.
- Transformation: Change is inevitable and often painful, but it leads to greater things.
- Truth: Illusions and lies crumble in time; only raw honesty endures.
- Ascension: Mortals can rise to meet the divine if they prove worthy through trials.

**Bonds**:
- I seek an ancient artifact whispered of in my homeland’s legends
- A vision or prophecy drew me across the sea — I must learn its meaning.
- I owe a life debt to someone lost in the shipwreck (or believe I do).
- My family’s honor depends on uncovering lost knowledge.
- I carry a fragment of an ancient map that points to a glowing stone said to hold the island’s heart.
- A recurring dream of swirling mists and distant songs has haunted me since childhood — I sailed east to find its source.
- I owe my life to a mysterious herbalist or sage who saved me once; their final words urged me toward the southeastern seas.
- My family’s honor was tarnished by a long-ago betrayal; I seek a lost relic to restore our name.
- A prophecy spoken by a dying seer claims I (or someone like me) will either save or doom the enchanted isle.
- I fled my homeland after awakening strange powers I couldn’t control; the sea was my only escape.
- A loved one vanished years ago on a voyage east — I believe they still live somewhere in the mists.
- I am bound by an oath to protect the natural world from unnatural blight and shadow.
- A shadowy patron promised me power in exchange for retrieving something from beyond the horizon.
- The ship I sailed on carried a priceless cargo — its loss is my responsibility to reclaim or atone for.
- Visions of wings and storms have called to me; I must discover if they are gift or curse.
- I carry a small, warm stone that pulses faintly — it began glowing brighter the closer we sailed to Eldrath.

**Flaws**:

- I hide a dark impulse or rage that surfaces in moments of stress.
- I fear losing control of the power I sense awakening within me.
- I hide a deep well of rage that surfaces when I feel nature being harmed or corrupted.
- I distrust anything civilized — cities, laws, even other people — and prefer the wild unpredictability of the island.
- Visions and whispers plague me; I fear they’re signs of madness rather than destiny.
- I crave power above all else and may sacrifice too much (or others) to claim it.
- I am haunted by guilt over a past failure that cost lives; I hesitate when others are at risk.
- I fear losing control of the strange energies awakening inside me.
- I am reckless when pursuing secrets or prophecies, ignoring danger to myself or the group.
- I cling too tightly to old mainland ways and resist the island’s call to change.
- I see enemies and corruption everywhere — even allies can seem suspect in my paranoia.
- I am drawn to fire, storms, or shadow in ways that feel dangerous and addictive.
- I sacrifice too readily for others, risking my own life without hesitation.
- I cannot abide deception; lies (even kind ones) trigger uncontrollable anger or withdrawal.

### Final Checklist

- [ ] Level 1 character sheet complete (name, race, class, background, stats, proficiencies, equipment)
- [ ] Backstory (1–2 paragraphs up to as long as you want) with mainland origin and reason for sailing east
- [ ] Personality traits, ideal, bond, and flaw
- [ ] One mundane trinket from your past life (If you choose)
- [ ] Be ready to discuss how your character might react to survival, mystery, and awakening power

Bring your concepts to Session 0 — we’ll refine them together and forge party connections.

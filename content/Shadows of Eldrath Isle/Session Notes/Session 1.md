**_(Dim the lights. Ambient sounds: building storm winds, thunder cracks, creaking wood, screams fading to waves. Pause dramatically. Read with escalating urgency to build tension.)_

The world you once knew is gone.

You were aboard the _Sea Wraith_, a salt-crusted caravel carving through the endless Trackless Sea, far southeast beyond Kara-Tur's golden shores. Whispers of a mist-veiled isle drew you—treasures lost, sins fled, fates calling. The crew muttered of Eldrath, where time twists and ancients sleep.

Then... the storm began.

**_(Voice rises to a roar. Pause 2 seconds.)_

Black clouds erupt like a god's wrath, lightning searing green veins across the sky. Winds scream with lost souls, waves tower like krakens. The ship pitches—masts groan, deck floods. Chaos erupts: sailors tumble overboard, ropes snap.

**Interactive Moment 1: Brace for the Surge** _(Pause narration. Address players individually or as group.)_ _The ship slams into a monstrous wave. Saltwater crashes over the rails, threatening to sweep you into the abyss. What do you do to hold fast?_ _(Call for Athletics (DC 13) or Acrobatics (DC 13) checks. Success: You lash to the rigging or grab a beam—minimal harm. Failure: You're battered against the hull (take 1d6 bludgeoning damage). Describe results flavorfully: "You cling like a barnacle!" or "The deck claims its toll!")_

The gale lulls for just a moment before swelling back up more violent. Planks shatter. A massive chunk of the mast explodes above as it is hit with a bolt of searing lighting. Splinters break free, hurtling toward the deck like a battering ram.

**Interactive Moment 2: Evade the Mast** _(Pause again. Quick rolls.)_ _Debris whistles through the air—the falling mast looms! Roll to dodge or deflect it._ _(Dexterity save (DC 14). Success: You roll aside or shove it clear—no extra harm. Failure: Crushing impact (1d8+2 bludgeoning damage). Flavor: "Timber cracks past your ear!" or "Pain explodes as it clips you!")_

_(After rolls, resume with lowered voice, building dread.)_

Final screams... the captain's curse swallowed by foam... then the world spins into oblivion. A bone-jarring _CRASH_—the _Sea Wraith_ impales on unseen reefs, hull rupturing like thunder as the world slowly fades to black.

_(Silence 5 seconds. Let damage sink in—track total HP loss secretly; level 1 starts battered but alive.)_

...Awareness flickers back. Hours? Days? Week? Your body throbs with bruises and salt-stung cuts _(reveal any lingering damage: e.g., "You awaken at X HP")_. Memories fragment: a half-spoken spell, a blade's grip, a beast's distant call, an oath in fog. Amnesia veils your past—who were you? Your purpose?

You lie on jagged obsidian rocks, waves gnashing nearby. Air thick with brine, wild herbs, damp earth. Bruised skies churn behind coiling mists, aglow with eerie phosphor. Wreckage litters the tide: planks, sails in kelp, crates half-buried. No bodies—gulls cry _words_ overhead.

Gear nearby, sodden but whole _(hand out starting equipment)_. Inland: volcanic cliffs to twisted thickets, leaves star-dewed.

A groan. Against a boulder slumps an elf-woman: moon-pale skin, silver hair blood-matted, emerald eyes opening. Vine-leathers, herb satchel spilled. Claw-gashes weep. She grips a pulsing crystal shard _(Heartstone fragment—faint inner light)_.

She coughs brine. "You... endure," she whispers, reed-like voice fierce. "I am Lirael, shore-guardian. Mists chose you. I dragged you from depths—but the storm... no mere gale. The _Blight_ awakens."

Mists writhe. Rustles from thickets: yellow eyes, black-veined wolves prowl, tar-foam dripping fangs. Howls chill the soul, stirring buried powers.

*(Pause. Initiative!) *

Lirael rises shakily, thorn-dagger drawn. "They smell awakening blood. We must fight or be fed to the shadows."

_(Seamless to combat: 2-3 blighted wolves—wolves +1d4 poison bite.)_


```statblock
monster: Blighted Wolf
```

_(The last blighted wolf crumples, its tar-like foam sizzling on the rocks. Lirael slumps against the boulder, breathing heavily, but her emerald eyes shine with quiet approval. She binds a fresh gash on her arm with a glowing herb poultice.)_

**Lirael:** _(voice steadying, like wind through ancient oaks)_ "Well struck, storm-tossed ones. Those curs were the Blight's first whisper—twisted by the shadows creeping from the isle's heart. Few survive their fangs... fewer still fight as one."

_(Pause for player reactions/questions: e.g., "Who are you?" or "What was that?")_

**Lirael:** "I am Lirael, last of the Veil Keepers—wardens of Eldrath's mists. This isle chose you, pulling you from the sea's jaws when the storm sought to claim all. See?" _(She holds up the pulsing crystal shard—faint green light dances within.)_ "The Heartstone stirred at your awakening. It binds fates... and woes."

_(If asked about amnesia/ship:)_ "The mists veil memories as they do the shores. They will clear—in time, through trials. You are not lost; you are _found_."

**Lirael:** _(rising, sheathing her thorned dagger)_ "But words won't mend wounds or fend the darkening woods. Come—my village, Mistwood, lies a short trek inland. Healers, hearth, answers await. Follow swift, ere more shadows prowl."

_(She gestures to a mist-parted path through the thickets, leading toward faint lantern glows. Transition to travel: Survival check optional, arrive at Mistwood gates.)_
